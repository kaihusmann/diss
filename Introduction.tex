\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
Decision making is the last step in the process of planning, starting with actually discovering the existence of a decision problem with at least two distinct alternatives. Complexity of the planning process, thereby determined through the type of decision, may vary from very simple daily decisions to extensive and long-lasting processes \citep[p. 3-4]{kangas_2015}. Relatively easy and quick daily decisions differ fundamentally from complexer decisions in terms of their problem structures, consequences, preferences of the decision-maker and solution evaluation \citep[p. 807-808]{keeney_1982}. While everyday choices in professional framework usually base on associative selections and personal preferences, crucial decisions or decisions with long-lasting impacts are often taken analytically with explicit inference (\citealp[p. 659, 672]{stanovich_2000}; \citealp[p. 3]{kangas_2015}). Those two different typos, which are often called \textit{systems} in behavioral sciences \citep[e.g.][p. 658]{stanovich_2000}, underly significantly different theorems. Following classical theory of decision examination, decisions can be described \textit{descriptively} or \textit{normatively} \citep[p. 6]{bitz_2005}. Examining decisions from descriptive perspective means evaluating individual and social actions. Descriptive theory analyses actual decisions with aim of examining how decision-makers act in reality and how decision making actually works. It analyses the principles of decision making descriptively without further investigation of purposes. Descriptive decision studies will answer the question \textit{how} but not \textit{why} decision-makers decide \citep[p. 499-501]{simon_1979}. Findings from descriptive studies hence do not allow drawing any conclusions about plausibility or reasonability. Lessons from empiric-descriptive analysis, however, do not necessarily lack reasonability. Descriptive decision theory just not inquiries rationals behind decisions \citep[p. 500]{simon_1979}. Target of the normative decision theory is examination of particular reasons behind actual decisions. Hence, in contrast to the descriptive theory, normative studies are rather evidence-based than empirically driven. They aim on theoretical explanation of the causal network which leads to decisions. Normative decision models are, usually computer-aided, mathematical, statistical or numerical computations trying to explain decision processes accounting for their intrinsic criteria. Whenever decision-makers are interested in the reasons of fairly complex decision problems, normatively examination will be obligatory. Normative decision examination forms the foundation of \textit{operations research} \citep[p. 498]{simon_1979}, an interdisciplinary discipline with elements from statistics, mathematics, economics and computer sciences which developed simultaneously with the first digital computers \citep{churchman_1957}. Operations research, also called management or decision sciences, is the science of building and using computer-aided models for decision support \citep[p. 373-374]{wacker_1998}. After successful identification of decision-relevant aspects, the gathered information can be used to built a statistical computer-aided model. A complete normative decision analysis is hence a prerequisite for the development of \textit{decision support systems} (DSS), nowadays mandatory tools for intermediate- and long-term decisions in professional framework. Most all modern decision support models lastly base upon classical decision theory as they basically translate normatively inquiry into applicable models for scientists, practitioners or any person being responsible for decisions.

Decisions in forest management never affect things solely. Once made, management decisions will have impact on lots of economic, ecologic and social issues. Forests should be manged such that they produce income for the forest owner (CITE MÖHing. 1997) on the one, while contemporaneously follow conservation and recreational issues, on the other hand \citep[p. 11]{kangas_2015}. Simultaneous fulfillment of all 3 functions is the guideline principle of the multifunctional forestry in Germany. It is firmly anchored in the Federal Forest Law (CITE MÖLLER). The concept of sustainability plays a central role in forestry. In one of its most recent and general definitions \textit{sustainability} states development of forests such that current and future generations can benefit from all 3 forest functions (\citealp[p. 14]{un_2005}; see also \citealp[p. 14]{kangas_2015}). In consequence, practice forest management decisions must exclude declining of several different aspects like \textit{biodiversity}, \textit{productivity} and \textit{regeneration capacity vitality} (Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, cited from \citealp[p. 15]{kangas_2015}). Forest management thus requires careful planning considering multiple criteria. Due to this complexity, decisions in practical forestry are rarely made by single persons. Forest operations planning usually bases on a complex collaboration of inventory and action planning being comprised of long-term strategies, intermediate-term management plans and short-term operational decisions. Intermediate-term forest planing typically relies on forest mensuration which is a long-established, continuously improved planning procedure trying implementing strategic orientations into spatial and temporal explicit operations \citep[p. 156-158]{bockmann_2004}. The degree of complexity of this planning is high and steadily rising. Increasing demand for wood as raw materials \citet[p. 8]{mantau_2012} as well an rising requirements on conservation and recreational issues presents new challenges for the forestry and wood sector in Germany and explains the need for detailed, rational decision support \citep[p. 1-2]{hansen_2012}. 

Inference based decision support tools like the \textit{Tree Growth Open Source Software} (TreeGrOSS) \citep{hansen_2014} are e.g. already integral part in the forest mensuration of Lower Saxony \citep[p. 158]{bockmann_2004}. Computer-aided forest simulation software in general has great opportunity for improvement effectiveness and accuracy of forest planning \citep[p. 210]{davis_2001}. They are advantageous against classical tables since they can consider much more relevant aspects for growth and yield such as tree individual concurrence, species mixtures, complex within-stand structures as well as specific thinning and usage rules (\citealp[p. 3]{hansen_2012} \citealp[p. 93]{muys_2010}). Optimization procedures were initially developed for calculating an efficient allocation of finite resources \citep[p. 271]{davis_2001}. Modern Growth and yield simulation software offer new

They are hence interesting for most every thinkable decision in forestry framework. Forest growth simulation based optimization models initially appeared in the 1980s. Early models were rather if-then calculation than

\label{sec:intro:aim}


Optimization methods in particular have great opportunity 

Despite all mentioned advantages, inference based decision support tools play only minor role in Germany. While forest growth and yield simulation softwares are  applied in forest mensuration 



, formally optimization procedures are recently not part of practical forest planning.

Optimization is useful to program sustainability \citep[p. 15]{kangas_2015}

Although the advantages of Decision Support Systems (DSS) are widely known and often discussed in forest-science literature, optimization procedures are recently seldom used in Germany. The forest management nowadays widely bases on expert knowledge and decades of experience. The strategic forest treatment is usually ruled by very detailed and long established forest programs. As the demands for wood as well as for further ecosystem benefits is steadily rising, forest planning becomes increasingly more complex. Looking at formal optimization techniques for decision support of forest activities, as they are already performed in foreign countries, therefore seems to be worthwhile. We present an optimization software as DSS for forest thinning activities on operational level which is specifically adopted to German characteristics.

According to the typically categorization of forest optimization models, we present a \textit{type-1} optimization software. Our software basically consists of 3 elements. The forest growth simulation module, the optimization module and the data warehouse. The tree growth is simulated with the TreeGrOSS which is an long established single-tree based growth and treatment simulation software of the Northwest German Research Institute (NW-FVA). The actual optimization bases on sequential TreeGROSS simulations with iteratively changing thinning intensity settings. The response of every iteration is calculated via dimension and tree species specific rating of the simulated harvested wood volume. To ensure sustainability of the simulations, we defined 2 restrictions. The total standing volume of all stands as well as the standing volume of each stand at the end of the simulation are not allowed to be lower than a predefined standing volume limit under standard treatment circumstances. The optimization model additionally enables definition of annual minimum harvesting volumes. As we could not find any suitable optimization algorithm, we developed a novel model basing on the ?Simulated Annealing? method. Our software is specifically parameterizable to the very complex data structure of the TreeGrOSS software. Our optimization software is already freely available as a package for the statistical software R via the Comprehensive R Archive Network. The forest stand data must be stored in a PostgreSQL database. Nagel and Hansen (NW-FVA) developed a software able to translate forest inventory data into TreeGrOSS stands.
We present the core-element
