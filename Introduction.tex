\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:Introduction}
Decision making is the last step in a process of planning, starting with actually discovering existence of a decision problem with at least two distinct options \citep[p. 3-4]{kangas_2015}. 

Describe Decisions generally

Following classical theory, 
studies on decision making can be of descriptive or normative type \citep[p. 6]{bitz_2005}. Examining decisions from descriptive perspective means evaluating individual and social actions. Descriptive decision theory analyses realistic decisions with aim of examining how decision-makers act in reality and how decision making actually works. It analyses the principles of decision making descriptively without further investigation. It is not said that lessons learned from empiric-descriptive analysis of decisions lack reasonability. Descriptive decision theory just not inquiries rational behind decisions. Task of the normative decision theory is searching the phenomena that explain reasons behind actual decisions. Normative decision theory only

Decisions in forest management never affect things solely. Once made, management decisions will have impact on lots of economic, ecologic and social issues.

Since \citet{Carlowitz_1713} introduced the principle of sustainability to forestry, it plays a central role in there, and over the last centuries it has been further developed and extended. To achieve and maintain sustainability in its different specifications \citep{Speidel_1984, Schanz_1996} can be seen as one of the main goals or even the main goal of forestry. A prerequisite for such a sustainable forestry is information on the forest resources, their conditions and changes. This information is usually gained through forest inventories.
