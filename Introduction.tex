\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
Decision making is the last step in the process of planning, starting with actually discovering the existence of a decision problem. Complexity of the planning process, thereby determined through the type of decision, may vary from very simple daily decisions to extensive and long-lasting decision processes \citep[p. 3-4]{kangas_2015}. Relatively easy and quick decisions differ fundamentally from complexer decisions in terms of their problem structures, consequences, preferences of the decision-maker and solution evaluation \citep[p. 807-808]{keeney_1982}. While everyday choices in professional framework usually base on associative selections and personal preferences, crucial decisions or decisions with long-lasting impacts are often taken analytically with explicit inference (\citealp[p. 659, 672]{stanovich_2000}; \citealp[p. 3]{kangas_2015}). Those two different typos, often called \textit{systems}, in behavioral sciences \citep[e.g.][p. 658]{stanovich_2000}, underly significantly different theorems. Following classical theory of decision examination, decisions can be described either \textit{descriptively} or \textit{normatively} \citep[p. 6]{bitz_2005}. Examining decisions from descriptive perspective means evaluating individual and social actions. Descriptive theory analyses actual decisions with aim of examining how decision-makers act in reality and how decision making actually works. It analyses the principles of decision making descriptively without further investigation of purposes. Descriptive decision studies will answer the question \textit{how} but not \textit{why} decision-makers decide \citep[p. 499-501]{simon_1979}. Findings from descriptive studies hence do not allow drawing any conclusions about plausibility or reasonability. Lessons from empiric-descriptive analysis, however, do not necessarily lack reasonability. Descriptive decision theory just not inquiries rationals behind decisions \citep[p. 500]{simon_1979}. Target of the normative decision theory is examination of particular reasons behind actual decisions. Hence, in contrast to the descriptive theory, normative studies are rather evidence-based than descriptive. They aim on theoretical explanation of the causal network which leads to decisions. Normative decision models are, usually computer-aided, mathematical, statistical or numerical computations trying to explain decision processes accounting for their intrinsic criteria. Whenever decision-makers are interested in the reasons of fairly complex decision problems, normatively examination will usually be obligatory. Normative decision examination forms the foundation of \textit{operations research} (\citealp[p. 112]{shim_2002}; \citealp[p. 498]{simon_1979}), an interdisciplinary discipline with elements from statistics, mathematics, economics and computer sciences which developed simultaneously with the first digital computers \citep{churchman_1957}. Operations research, also called management or decision sciences, is the science of building and using computer-aided models for decision support \citep[p. 373-374]{wacker_1998}, nowadays mandatory tools for intermediate- and long-term decisions in professional framework. Operations research hence builds the theoretical background of all modern computer-aided programs for decision support, also called \textit{decision support systems} (DSS). DSS are computer system of crucial variables and rules that structure the programmable part of a decision problem. Since the initial definition of DSS in \citet[p. 26]{gorry_1971}, it is stated that decision processes must be simplified into programmable elements. As programmable the elements of DSS are usually examined via statistical inference such as regression or variance analysis, applied statistical models are mandatory tools right from the beginning of operations research \citep{churchman_1957}. All further elements, in particular non-programmable processes that are unstructured or far too complex, cannot be considered in DSS. Prior to implementing statistical computer-aided models, decision-relevant aspects must be gathered, reviewed and simplified. Only after successful identification of programmable and meaningful decision-relevant aspects, the gathered information can be used to built a statistical computer-aided model. A complete, accurate normative decision analysis is hence a prerequisite for the development of DSS. Most all modern decision support models lastly base upon classical decision theory as they basically translate normatively inquiry into applicable models for scientists, practitioners or any person being responsible for decisions. DSS aim on objective, theory-based solutions of real decision problems. Next to the actual variables and rules which are translated into program code, typical DSS therefore have a user front-end and a data-warehouse (\citealp[p. 2]{hansen_2012}; \citealp[p. 115]{shim_2002}). The user front-end facilitates application for the user, the data-warehouse enables storage of necessary input data and the solution.

Decisions in forest management will never affect things solely. Once made, management decisions will have impact on lots of economic, ecologic and social issues. Forests should be manged such that they produce income for the forest owner (CITE MÖHing. 1997 OR Waldeigentum 923 Dep in BBF) on the one, while contemporaneously follow conservation and recreational issues, on the other hand \citep[p. 11]{kangas_2015}. Simultaneous fulfillment of all 3 functions is the guideline principle of the multifunctional forestry in Germany. It is firmly anchored in the Federal Forest Law \citep[p. 457]{moller_2007}. The concept of \textit{sustainability} plays a central role in forestry. In one of its most recent and general definitions sustainability states development of forests such that current and future generations can benefit from all 3 forest functions (\citealp[p. 14]{un_2005}; see also \citealp[p. 14]{kangas_2015}). In consequence, practice forest management decisions must exclude declining of several different aspects like \textit{biodiversity}, \textit{productivity} and \textit{regeneration capacity vitality} (Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, cited from \citealp[p. 15]{kangas_2015}). Forest management thus requires careful planning considering multiple criteria. Due to this complexity, decisions in practical forestry are rarely made by single persons. Forest operations planning usually bases on a complex collaboration of inventory and action planning being comprised of long-term strategies, intermediate-term management plans and short-term operational decisions. Intermediate-term forest planing typically relies on forest mensuration which is a long-established, continuously improved planning procedure trying implementing strategic orientations into spatial and temporal explicit operations \citep[p. 156-158]{bockmann_2004}. In addition to the high degree of complexity, further challenges foresters typically have to cope with, are the long-lasting consequences of their operations. Intermediate-term planning already comprises time periods of 5-20 years \citep[p. 12]{kangas_2015}. Daily operational decisions of foresters, such as harvesting on stand level or planting will usually have consequences that last much longer than any plan. Next to an increasing demand for wood as raw materials \citet[p. 8]{mantau_2012}, requirements on conservation and recreational issues are rising as well. Germany's national strategy of biological diversity e.g. provides natural development on 10\% of public owned and 5\% of private owned forests \citep[p. 45]{bmu_2007} which means that more than 700,000 hectare of forest land is to be set-aside by 2020 \citep{ti_2014}. Increasing demand for wood, decreasing available productive area and contemporaneously increasing recreational issues \citep[p. 1]{hansen_2012} hence pose new challenges for the forestry and wood sector. The degree of complexity in forest operations is thus expected to increase even further which explains the need for detailed, rational decision support \citep[p. 2]{hansen_2012}. 

DSS can be used to structure the highly complex decision problems into smaller, programmable sub-problems and finally facilitate and solve many decision problems in forest practice and sciences. The advantages of DSS for forestry purposes were already discovered in the early 1980s \citep[p. 499]{reynolds_2008}. Nowadays, numerous examples of useful DSS can be found in forest practice and forest sciences covering a very broad range of purposes. Very simple DSS in forestry are e.g the generalized \textit{maximin} method or the \textit{certainty equivalent} method \citep[p. 25, 28]{kangas_2015}. Complex inference based decision support tools like the \textit{WaldPlaner} \citep{hansen_2014} are already relevant part in the practical forest mensuration of Lower Saxony \citep[p. 158]{bockmann_2004}. WaldPlaner is a DSS for practitioners and scientists with user-friendly interface which combines a data-warehouse with the long-established and widely used tree growth and yield simulation software \textit{Tree Growth Open Source Software} (TreeGrOSS) (\citealp[p. 46]{hansen_2014}; \citealp{nagel_2009}). It enables i.e. growth and yield simulation of multiple forest stands. Computer-aided forest simulation software in general has great opportunity for improvement effectiveness and accuracy of forest planning \citep[p. 210]{davis_2001}. They are advantageous against classical tables since they can consider much more relevant aspects for growth and yield such as tree individual concurrence, species mixtures, complex within-stand structures as well as specific thinning and usage rules (\citealp[p. 3]{hansen_2012} \citealp[p. 93]{muys_2010}).

Right from the beginning of DSS in forestry framework, optimization techniques came to use \citep[p. 16]{kangas_2015}. As optimization procedures were initially developed for efficient allocation of finite resources \citep[p. 271]{davis_2001}, they suit to many decision problems in forestry, a field with naturally scarce resources. Recently, combinations of modern growth and yield simulation software and optimization procedures are in focus of forestry research. Co-application of growth simulators and optimization procedures offers advantages for practical production planning as it enables foresters to respect changing environmental circumstances such as climate change or nitrogen deposition in their operational short-term decisions \citep[p. 1081]{pretzsch_2008}.  \citep{yousefpour_2009} e.g. developed a optimization model able to optimize thinning activity in terms of economic return also taking timber production, carbon storage and biodiversity issues into account. They combine the growth and yield simulation software TreeGrOSS with the \textit{dynamic linear programming} optimization procedure. Combined growth and yield optimization methods are not novel in forestry. The \textit{United States Forest Service} uses combined methods for practical forest planning since the 1970s \citep[p. 33]{hoganson_2015}. But since both growth and yield simulation models as well as optimization methods have developed considerably in the last decade, modern combined methods have opportunity to solve more sophisticated decision problems in forestry \citep[p. 16-17]{kangas_2015}.

\section{The role of bio-economy in forestry}
\label{sec:intro:biecon}
Bio-economy is defined as a combination of all economic sectors that refine biologic resources with physical, chemical and biotechnological processes \citep[p. 10462]{debesi_2015}. The bio-economy itself is hence no novel sector but an aggregation of former separately regarded sectors which all base on biomass as major resource. Main advantages of bio-economy as an novel, aggregated sector are i.a. research cooperations of former distinct industries in order to benefit from synergy as well as commonly balanced supply chains. This cooperation is advantageous from view of forestry as primary economic sector as it could improve possibilities of planning. If the supply chains of many smaller firms are comprised to a integrated super-regional supply chain including interactions between the firms, which is one aim of bio-economy, logistical planning for forest enterprises could be simplified. Supplying a well-prepared integrated logistic system will be advantageous in terms of planning dependability and planning costs against smaller and distinct systems. Furthermore, from perspective of forestry, a common balance of required resources provides advantages in planning. Using modern simulation techniques, forecasting of wood potential is relatively easy. It is hence often practiced in the context of cluster studies \citep[e.g.][]{bmel_2016}, scientific studies (e.g. chapter \ref{chap:hzb}) or practical mensuration \citep[][p. 158]{bockmann_2004}. Sound knowledge of resources demands for longer time periods will thus have severe positive effects on intermediate-term forest planning as demand can be matched with the forecasted available wood potential.

With a overall turnover of 2 trillion {\euro} in 2014, covering biology-based resources from agriculture and forestry, the European Union's bio-economy sector is leading in worldwide comparison \citep[p. 221, 223]{elchichakli_2016} with especially Germany playing an important role in that scope \citep[p. 200]{hennig_2016}. Although the share of forestry itself as primary producer amounts only to 2 \% (35 billion {\euro}), forestry plays currently an crucial role for resource supply in the bio-economy sector. Paper and wood manufactures had a turnover of 331 {\euro} in 2014. The bio-based sector covering agriculture, forestry and fishery is a considerable factor in Germany's national economy as well. The share of bio-based economy on Germany's gross value was approximately 8 \% in 2007 including primary production as well as manufacturing and services \citep[p. 29-30]{efken_2012}. In the national bio-economy strategy, the German Government decided to strengthen the bio-based industries by 2030 \citep[p. 15-16]{bmel_2014b}. Innovative bio-based products have opportunity to substitute traditionally oil-based end- and semifinished products. There is thus, from industrial perspective, demand for woody biomass that could further increase. Novel production methods could enhance significance of forest biomass, in particular of small dimensioned wood, for use in bio-refineries. \citet[p. 49]{ekman_2013} e.g. revealed woody biomass to have great potential for chemical semifinished products. Regarding the political and economical circumstances, the importance of bio-economy sector generally and in particular for forestry is thus expected to increase.

Although the advantages of Decision Support Systems (DSS) are widely known and often discussed in forest-science literature, optimization procedures are recently seldom used in Germany. The forest management nowadays widely bases on expert knowledge and decades of experience. The strategic forest treatment is usually ruled by very detailed and long established forest programs. As the demands for wood as well as for further ecosystem benefits is steadily rising, forest planning becomes increasingly more complex. Looking at formal optimization techniques for decision support of forest activities, as they are already performed in foreign countries, therefore seems to be worthwhile. We present an optimization software as DSS for forest thinning activities on operational level which is specifically adopted to German characteristics.

According to the typically categorization of forest optimization models, we present a \textit{type-1} optimization software. Our software basically consists of 3 elements. The forest growth simulation module, the optimization module and the data warehouse. The tree growth is simulated with the TreeGrOSS which is an long established single-tree based growth and treatment simulation software of the Northwest German Research Institute (NW-FVA). The actual optimization bases on sequential TreeGROSS simulations with iteratively changing thinning intensity settings. The response of every iteration is calculated via dimension and tree species specific rating of the simulated harvested wood volume. To ensure sustainability of the simulations, we defined 2 restrictions. The total standing volume of all stands as well as the standing volume of each stand at the end of the simulation are not allowed to be lower than a predefined standing volume limit under standard treatment circumstances. The optimization model additionally enables definition of annual minimum harvesting volumes. As we could not find any suitable optimization algorithm, we developed a novel model basing on the ?Simulated Annealing? method. Our software is specifically parameterizable to the very complex data structure of the TreeGrOSS software. Our optimization software is already freely available as a package for the statistical software R via the Comprehensive R Archive Network. The forest stand data must be stored in a PostgreSQL database. Nagel and Hansen (NW-FVA) developed a software able to translate forest inventory data into TreeGrOSS stands.
We present the core-element
