\section*{Abstract}
\label{chap:beech_crowns:Abstract}
Long-term forest development programs in Germany aim on an increase of close-to-nature broadleaf forest stands. This means that the economic importance of European beech is expected to increase. The economic potential of a tree basically consists of the stem as well as the economically viable wood volume in the crown. Due to the high morphological variability of European beech crowns, taper models are often not satisfactory for predicting the economically viable wood volume arising from crowns. Prediction models with a higher precision are recently still lacking. Aim of this study is thus the development of prediction model for the economically viable crown wood volume of European beech trees.

We determined the distribution of the wood volume in the crown over the branch diameters using the multistage "randomized branch sampling" method (RBS). The tree-specific wood volume distribution on the branch diameters were used to cluster all sampled trees into 3 groups. Additionally, we developed a method able to distinguish between economically viable and unviable crown branches. Basing on the RBS measurements as well as revenues and processing costs, we modeled the economically viable wood volume from the crown for each tree. To calculate the wood volume under bark, we parameterized a bark thickness function from disk samples of the trees.

We showed that the European beech crowns could be clustered into 3 groups differing in their wood volume distribution. The economically viable wood volume in the crown significantly depended on this grouping parameter as well as diameter at breast height (DBH). By contrast, the total amount of wood in the crown only depended on DBH. The differing viable wood volumes in the crowns were thus explained by different wood distributions and not by differing total crown wood volume. To make the results applicable in practice forestry, the modeling results were used to develop a regression formula able to predict the economically viable wood volume in the crown depending on the DBH and the crown type. As the crown type can also be predicted via measurable tree covariates, the regression model of the viable wood volume in the crown can be used as a support tool for the management of European beech stands. Sensitivity analysis quantifies how harvest revenues and costs translate into different viable tree volume.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:beech_crowns:Introduction}
Although European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests have been identified as the dominant forest communities in the potential natural vegetation of Germany \citep{fanc_2010}, with 1,680,072 ha, they currently only account for 15 \% of Germany?s forest stand cover \citep{ti_2014b}. Long-term ecological forest development programs result in a general increase in deciduous tree species with a focus on European beech \citep{mfacp_2004}. The economic importance of European beech will thus further increase.

Traditionally the objective of European beech management is to maximize valuable stem wood \citep{nagel_2008}. Especially under the perspective of modern utilization methods like bio-economics \citep{hildebrandt_2014} and the increasing demand for fuel wood \citep{mantau_2012}, the economic importance of smaller branches of European beech is expected to increase. Thus a large proportion of the economic potential lies in smaller branches. Under certain conditions, further economic potential can be found in the tree stump and foliage \citep{miettinen_2014}. For a suitable management of European beech stands, it is necessary to assess the economically viable wood cut fully \citep{mohring_1997}. Therefore, as well as predicting the wood from the sympodial stem, it is also necessary to predict the economically viable wood cut in the sympodial crown. In the complex crowns of broadleaf trees, the economically viable wood can be substantially smaller than the whole wood volume. For this purpose, a model able to distinguish the economically viable wood volume from the whole wood volume in the crown is needed. For the stem volume prediction, there are many different and sophisticated tariff and other functions available. Cubic taper models exist, providing an adequate prediction of the economic potential of coniferous trees and the stems of deciduous trees \citep{kuzelka_2012}. However, those taper functions do not account for the complex sympodial form above the crown base of broadleaf tree species where the wood volume is not allocated around a throughout stem axis. They are therefore imprecise in predicting the wood volume arising above the crown base. They are usually calibrated for a minimum small-end diameter threshold of 7 cm. This small-end diameter can lack economic interpretation.

The aim of this study is to develop a parametric, practically usable prediction model of the economically viable wood volume in the crown of European beech trees. For this purpose, 163 beech trees were felled. Using the multistage "Randomized Branch Sampling" (RBS) method \citep{gaffrey_1999}, a sound sample of branches was measured from each tree. The measurements were taken to examine the tree individual distribution of the wood volume in the crown on the crown branches. To develop tree individual morphological covariates, the sampled trees were clustered into groups with differing wood volume distribution. A multinomial regression model enables the prediction of this covariate via measurable tree attributes. We additionally developed a model, which predicts the viable wood volume from the measured wood volume distribution. This viable wood volume does not depend on freely selected but on economically justified small-end diameters. We developed a method to classify economically viable and unviable branches in European beech crowns via a break-even analysis. Then only the wood volumes of viable branches were estimated via RBS. The modeled economically viable wood volume thus depends on the size of the tree and the volume distribution in the crown. To calculate the wood volume under bark, we parameterized a new bark thickness function from disk samples of the trees.
To make the results applicable in forest practice, we performed a regression analysis with the modeled economically viable wood volume and further tree covariates. To ensure the applicability, we only used practically measurable tree attributes. The regression model represents a new approach for modeling the economic potential of European beech crowns and therefore a novel decision support tool for forest management operations.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:beech_crowns:methods}
The dataset for this study comprised measurements from a destructive sample of 163 European beech trees sampled using the multistage RBS method \citep{gaffrey_1999, jessen_1955}. These data were compiled from 2 existing databases at the Northwest German Forest Research Station and the Baden-Württemberg Forest Research Centre.

\subsection{Selection of trees}
\label{subsec:beech_crowns:methods:tree_selection}
The data were collected during 2009 and 2014. Altogether 163 trees were destructively sampled. In order to cover as many growth zones as possible, the sample plots were distributed throughout Germany (Figure \ref{fig:beech_crowns:fig1}). To ensure representation of the entire relevant diameter range, we chose up to 3 forest sites with different stand ages within these growth zones. All selected sites were high forests under standard management regimes. Depending on the area size of the plot, 2 - 4 sample trees were selected. In addition to the morphological measurements via RBS, DBH and tree height were measured (Table \ref{tab:beech_crowns:tab1}).

\subsection{Selection of disks}
\label{subsec:beech_crowns:methods:disk_selection}

To subtract bark from the wood volume, stem and branch disks for bark thickness measurement were taken from 37 trees of the NW-FVA study (Table \ref{tab:beech_crowns:tab2}). Up to 6 disks were randomly selected using the importance sampling method \citep{Gregoire_2008}. The proxy function, which is necessary for calculation of the sampling probability, was derived by the volume distribution of the branch diameters over the approximated tree height (which were both measured for volume estimation via RBS anyway). The selection probability of the disks was thus proportional to their disk diameter. Diameter and the bark thickness of the disks were measured at 4 directions of the selected disks directly after extraction.

\subsection{Selection of branches}
\label{subsec:beech_crowns:methods:branch_selection}
The estimation of the wood volume in the crown was based on the RBS method of multistage probability sampling. RBS is an unbiased method of probability sampling used for estimating specific tree parameters by measurable auxiliary variables \citep{jessen_1955,gaffrey_1999}. In our application, RBS enables estimation of the wood volume in the crown or in specific parts of the crown by measuring only a sample of branch segments instead of measuring all branch segments in the crown. Only relatively few measurements of branch diameters and branch segment lengths have to be taken for an accurate estimate of the whole wood volume in the crown or the wood volume of specific crown parts.

RBS is based on the knowledge of the conditional probability $q_{lj}$ of choosing the $j$-th out of n "branches" at a "node" $l$ in the crown instead of choosing another branch of this node. The probability $q_{lj}$ can be calculated by an auxiliary variable instead of the (complicated measurable) target variable itself \citep{gregoire_1995,Gregoire_2008,valentine_1984}. Instead of measuring the volume of all branches at a node, in our case, we only had to measure the base diameters $d_{lj}$ of the branches to calculate $q_{lj}$ and the volume of one branch. As \citet{west_1999} examined an allometric coefficient of 2.67 between branch volume and branch base diameter, the branch base diameter to the power of 2.67 is expected to provide efficient estimates. In our study, the conditional probability has been selected to be

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:beech_crowns:eq1}
	q_{lj}(d)=d_{lj}^{2.67}/ \sum_{j=1}^{n_l} d_{lj}^{2.67}
\end{equation}

Thus once all branch base diameters $d_{li}$ at a node were recorded, one of the branches can be randomly chosen with probability $q_{lj}$. Only the "segment" volume of this chosen branch has to be measured, where a "segment" is defined as the part of the branch between 2 nodes \citep{Gregoire_2008}. We chose the formula for a conical frustum (Equation \ref{eq:beech_crowns:eq2}) to calculate the segment volume $v_{lj}$ via the branch base diameter $d_{lj}$, the base diameter at the following node $d_{lj+1}$ and the segment length $h_{lj}$. The volume of the following node $d_{lj+1}$ was also measured and added to the segment volume $v_{lj}$.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:beech_crowns:eq2}
	v_\mathit{lj}=\frac{h_{lj}\pi}{12}\left(d_{lj}^2+d_{lj}d_{{lj}+1}+d_{{lj}+1}^2\right)
\end{equation}

The crown base, which is the height where the throughout stem ends and the sympodial crown starts, represented the first node of the RBS procedure. To have a measurable criterion, we defined the crown base to be the tree height where a branch base diameter was > 1/5 of the stem diameter at that height. A whole RBS path thus consisted of a succession of randomly selected branch segments from the crown base up to one shoot bud. Along the path all branch base diameters and all segment volumes were measured. In order to get an idea of the variation, 3 random and distinct RBS paths were obtained for each of the 163 sampled trees.

\subsection{Estimation of wood volume in the stem and in the crown}
\label{subsec:beech_crowns:methods:crown_vol_est}
The calculation method for the point estimates of the volumes as well as for the estimated variance is described in the literature \citep[e. g.][]{Gregoire_2008}. The stem form was assessed by section-wise diameter measurements at certain tree heights up to the crown base. The sum of these section volumes, also calculated by the conical frustum formula (Equation 2), gave the whole stem volume from the ground up to the crown base.

\subsubsection{Crown type differentiation}
\label{subsubsec:beech_crowns:methods:viable:crown_types}
To calculate the volume distribution according to the branch diameters in individual tree crowns, the cumulative wood volume amount $\hat{V}_i(d)$ in the crown was calculated from the crown base up to each recorded branch base diameter $(d)$ along each RBS path. This distribution was normalized by dividing the predicted cumulative crown volume below $\hat{V}_i(d)$ [m3] by the whole wood volume from the crown $\hat{V}_i(0)$ [m3] (Equation \ref{eq:beech_crowns:eq3}) and by dividing the base diameter of every branch $d_{ij}$ by the maximum diameter found $d_{max}$. $F(d)$ thus denotes the wood volume amount over branch diameter in the crown.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:beech_crowns:eq3}
F\left(d\right)=\frac{{\widehat V}_i\left(d\right)}{\widehat V}
\end{equation}

The diameter where half of the wood volume amount was located above (below respectively) was interpreted as the median branch diameter of a tree crown. This median volume branch diameter $F(d_{0.5})$ was easily interpolated from the generated diameter distribution for every RBS path, where $d_{0.5}$ denotes the branch diameter for which $F(d_{0.5})=0.5*F(d_{max})$. The same appears for the lower $F(d_{0.25})$ and upper quantile $F(d_{0.75})$. The curve trend of $F(d)$ over branch diameter thus indicates whether most of the wood volume is located in relatively small or in larger branches. Generally, there were 3 types of volume distribution in the data (Fig. \ref{fig:beech_crowns:fig2}). The first type showed a high share of volume in relatively small branch dimensions (left). The median branch diameter of these trees was close to the lower quantile. In the balanced type (center), half of the wood volume was found above a branch diameter that was approximately half the size of the largest diameter of the respective tree. In the third type (right), major part of wood volume was allocated in the larger branch diameter range. The median diameter was close to the upper quantile.

\begin{figure}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Grafiken/beech_crowns/Fig_2_relative_volume_amount.eps}
	\caption{Cumulative crown wood volume over relative branch diameter for 3 exemplary trees. For each tree all 3 RBS paths are displayed. The diameters where half of the timber volume is located above, respective below (the median relative branch diameter) are marked by vertical lines.}
	\label{fig:beech_crowns:fig2}
\end{figure}

As there were 3 paths per tree, the tree individual median diameter was calculated by the median of the 3 median branch diameters. The lower and upper quartiles were created in the same way. We thus generated 3 tree individual continuous variables. These enabled a clustering of the trees into 3 crown types which differ in their wood volume amount. As the crown types based on the volume distribution in the crowns, they should represent groups with different economically viable wood volumes. We chose the "k-means" cluster algorithm \citep{r_core_team_2016}, which minimizes the within-cluster Euclidean distance among observations and group means by the sum-of-squares method \citep{wagstaff_2001}, to cluster the data into 3 morphological crown types.

The median tree diameter as well as the quantile tree diameters are not measurable in practice. To differentiate a beach crown into 1 of the 3 mentioned groups in forest management, it is thus necessary to predict the crown type by other tree attributes. A multinomial logistic regression method \citep{hutcheson_2008} was parameterized to predict the crown type clusters from practically measurable morphological tree variables $x_i$ (equation 4). In this case, the $x_i$ are the DBH, the tree height, the tree height at crown base and the ratio of the base diameters at crown base. The ratios of the branch diameters at crown base were calculated by dividing the 2nd largest base diameter at the crown base by the respective largest branch diameter.

We fitted a log odd model with $J=3$ categories to a probability function which predicts the probability that an individual tree is belonging to a crown type category $j$ rather than to the reference category $j^{'}= 1$ by $i=4$ variables.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:beech_crowns:eq4}
\operatorname{log}\left(\frac{P\left(Y=j\right)}{P\left(Y=j^{'}\right)}\right)=\beta_{j0}+\beta_{j1}x_{1}+\beta_{j2}x_{2}+\dots+\beta_{ji}x_{i}
\end{equation}

The probability of an individual to belong to group j in relation to the reference is therefore calculated as

\begin{equation*}
P\left(Y=j\right)=\frac{\operatorname{exp}\left(\beta_{0}+\beta_{j1}x_{1}+\beta_{j2}x_{2}+\dots+\beta_{jk}x_{k}\right)}{1+\operatorname{exp}\left(\beta_{0}+\beta_{j1}x_1+\beta_{j2}x_{2}+\dots+\beta_{jk}x_{k}\right)}=\frac{exp(\boldsymbol{x}_i^{'}\boldsymbol{\beta}_j)}{1+exp(\boldsymbol{x}_i^{'}\boldsymbol{\beta}_j)}
\end{equation*}

and the probability of an individual to belong to group j considering all groups calculates as

\begin{equation*}
P\left(Y=j\right)=\frac{exp(\boldsymbol{x}_i^{'}\boldsymbol{\beta}_j)}{1+\sum_{s=1,s\neq j'}^{J} exp(\boldsymbol{x}_i^{'}\boldsymbol{\beta}_s)}
\end{equation*}

where crown type 1 represented the reference category $j^{'}$. The model was fitted with the R package "NNET" \citep{venables_2002}. The significance of a variable was examined by linear discriminant analysis. For model quality testing we predicted the crown type with our model and compared the result with the actual crown classification by the k-means analysis. This classification was performed by a leave-one-out cross-validation \citep[R package "MASS";][]{venables_2002} and an in-sample reclassification.

\subsubsection{Modelling the economically viable wood volume in the crown}
\label{subsubsec:beech_crowns:methods:viable:econ_viable}
As biasedness of the point and the variance estimate do not depend on the number of stages, RBS also allows the volume estimation of specific parts in the crown \citep{cancino_2005}. We used this property to estimate the tree individual viable wood volume in the crown only. For this, we programmed a model that distinguished the economically viable from economically unviable branches in the RBS sample (Algorithm 1). After running the algorithm, only the economically viable branches were then used to estimate the wood volume via the RBS method. The predicted wood volume after application of the separation algorithm thus reflected the economically viable wood volume in the crown.

\label{alg:beech_crowns:alg1}
\end{algorithm}

To distinguish viable from unviable branches, each RBS node and subsequent selected branch segment were aggregated into one "branch structure". In the event that many nodes occurred in close succession (no branch segments in between), they were regarded as one large node and aggregated with the following node and branch segment to form a large branch structure.

Each of the branch structures were then, starting at the crown base, successively rated in terms of revenue and cost. The revenue was calculated by multiplying wood volume [$\text{m}^3$] (under bark) by timber price [$\text{\euro} \text{m}^{-3}$]. The cost associated with any one branch structure was assumed to be constant per processing step and was interpreted as marginal cost \citep{mohring_1997} of processing this branch structure. Whenever a branch structure had a positive marginal return, it was additionally proofed if the former branch structure was viable. If this was the case, the branch structure was labeled to be economically viable. A branch segment is thus only considered as economically viable if its piece-volume is large enough to have a positive marginal return. If a former branch structure was unviable, the processing costs doubled, because the continuation of processing thereafter would require an additional cut. Each RBS path of every crown thus had a specific break-even point \citep{starr_1975} after which further processing would result in lower marginal returns. The small-end diameter of this last viable branch structure was recorded. The model was programmed in the statistical programming language R \citep{r_core_team_2016}.

After neglecting the unviable branch structures, the tree individual viable wood volume from the crown as well as the variance were estimated by means of RBS. The final small-end diameter of an individual tree was defined as the mean of the end diameter of all 3 paths.

The model (Algorithm \ref{alg:beech_crowns:alg1}) thus needed timber price [$\text{\euro} \; \text{m}^{-3}$] (under bark) and marginal costs [$\text{\euro} \; \text{processing step}^{-1}$] as input parameters. It was parameterized with commonly used values to ensure realistic results. The revenue was set to 50 $\text{\euro} \; \text{m}^{-3}$ (under bark) to reflect the common price for industrial wood in Germany in 2016 \citep{degenhard_2016}. The fixed cost parameter was based on the European beech wages table from the forest entrepreneurs association \citep{haarhaus_2012}, which assumes an 125 \% entrepreneur fee and 19 \% value added tax. Based on the assumptions that each node occurring represented one processing step and that the costs of each were constant, the costs amounted to 0.35 $\text{\euro} \; \text{processing step}^{-1}$. The model outputs were the economically viable wood from the crown (under bark) [$\text{m}^3$] and small-end diameter [mm].

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:beech_crowns:eq5}
\begin{aligned}y&=\beta\prod_{i=1}^kx_i^{\alpha_i}\\\leftrightarrow\operatorname{log}\left(y\right)&=\operatorname{log}\left(\beta\right)+\sum_{i=1}^k\alpha_i\operatorname{log}\left(x_i\right)\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The modeled viable wood volumes were used to parameterize an allometric growth model (Equation \ref{eq:beech_crowns:eq5}) with $k$ covariates. This parametric regression model allows forecasting of the economically viable crown wood volume by measurable covariates and is therefore easily applicable in forest management. For this purpose, sets of results, differing in their parameterization of input variables, were generated with the viable wood volume prediction model (Algorithm \ref{alg:beech_crowns:alg1}). The revenue as well as the cost input parameters were firstly set to the common parameter combination (50 $\text{\euro} \; \text{m}^{-3}$, 0.35 \euro \; $\text{step}^{-1}$) and then separately changed by 20 \%. Altogether, there were 9 result sets generated where each set of results involved 163 datasets. Because there were void datasets, whenever the algorithm assigned no viable wood volume in the crown, the data reduced to 1347 datasets. The regression analysis was composed of the covariates DBH, tree height, tree height at crown base, crown width, diameter ration at crown base and tree age as well as crown type, revenue scenario and cost scenario, which both functioned as dummy variable. The dependent variable was the modeled economically viable wood volume in the crown. The significance analysis and the model parameterization were performed by a "Generalized Linear Model" \citep[R Package "stats";][]{r_core_team_2016}. Proof of the significant impact of the covariates on $\alpha$ was not possible due to insufficient crown type 3 observations in larger DBH dimensions. The significance analysis was thus performed on $\beta$. Linearity and homoscedasticity were achieved by a Gamma distributed log-link function \citep{wood_2006}.

%% Allometric relationships %%
%%--------------------------%%
\subsection{Allometric relationships}
\label{subsec:beech_crowns:methods:allo}
In the metabolic scaling theory, the relationship between two plant organs ($y$ and $x$, see also Equation \ref{eq:beech_crowns:eq5}) can be described by a power law \citep{huxley_1932,niklas_1994}. This power law interprets the intraspecific relationship between plant organs for a given species. The variability of the relationship describes the strength of the allometry \citep{pretzsch_2010,west_1997}. Allometric model are thus useful to investigate the relationship between variables of economic interest and further tree attributes.

To consider the assumption of allometric regressions \citep{stumpf_2012}, we transformed the data by taking the natural logarithm. The relationships were regressed with the "standardized major axis" method \citep[R package "SMATR";][]{warton_2012}. The retransformation bias was estimated and corrected from the residual standard error of the log linear model \citep{sprugel_1983}.

\subsection{Prediction of bark thickness}
\label{subsec:beech_crowns:results:bark}
To subtract the bark from the wood volume, models for the double bark thickness over branch diameter are necessary. The predicted double bark thickness enabled the bark subtraction from both sides of the RBS diameter measurements. The commonly used double bark thickness model of \citet{altherr_1978} was parameterized with stem and branch disks of diameters above 7 cm. As the wood volume model in this study should be able to predict smaller branches as well, parameterization of an own bark thickness model became necessary. In addition, comparison of the observed bark thickness to the predicted bark thickness with the equation by \citet{altherr_1978} revealed that application of the Altherr model would have led to an overestimation of the bark thickness. The estimated double bark thickness with the function by \citet{altherr_1978} was 1.4 mm higher than with the new parameterized function for branches with a diameter of 10 cm. For branches with diameter of 30 cm, the difference amounted to 3.1 mm.

The double bark thickness regression equation was calculated via a "Generalized Additive Mixed Model" \citep{wood_2006} using the untransformed normally distributed identity link function. A linear curve trend was found in the bark thickness model (Fig \ref{fig:beech_crowns:fig3}). There were multiple measurements in one tree (see section \ref{subsec:beech_crowns:methods:disk_selection}). To exclude regional as well as tree specific influences, the tree id was considered a random effect. As we found heteroscedasticity, we weighted our data by a power function, which was parameterized by the model residuals over the fitted values.

\end{figure}

The model (Table \ref{tab:beech_crowns:tab3}) represented a valid method for subtracting bark from both sides of every morphological RBS diameter measurement. The volume calculation after bark subtraction via RBS thus predicts the volume under bark. This was also done for the section-wise stem diameter measurements to predict the stem wood volume under bark.

All calculated and measured crown morphology variables and tree metadata, including mean coefficient of variation for the data estimated by the RBS method, are summarized in Table \ref{tab:beech_crowns:tab4}. The crown type classification analyses were based on the median branch diameter and the branch diameter quartiles. The other tree variables were then used to parameterize a prediction model for the crown type classes.

The trees were clustered into 3 groups, where 50 trees were assigned to the first (bulk of volume in smaller branches), 69 to the second (balanced volume allocation) and 44 to the third (bulk of volume in larger branches) crown type. As median and quantile tree diameters cannot be measured practically but the model shall be applicable in forest management, the influence of measurable variables on the crown types was assessed. The influence of tree attributes on the crown type was tested by linear discriminant analysis \citep{venables_2002}, analysis of variance and deviance \citep{chambers_1992} as well as analysis of Akaike Information Criterion \citep{akaike_1981}. Only significant variables and interactions were chosen as regression parameters (Table 5). The analysis of variance revealed the significance of the diameter ratio at crown base $DR$. Deviance of the residuals (310.3 without $DR$) as well as AIC (330.0 without $DR$) were also substantially improved by this variable. Due to their high linear correlation with the significant variables, tree age and crown width were insignificant. The model is applied by plugging the coefficients of Table \ref{tab:beech_crowns:tab5} into Equation \ref{eq:beech_crowns:eq4}.

\subsubsection{Modelling the economically viable wood volume in the crown}
\label{subsubsec:beech_crowns:results:viable:econ_viable}
Table \ref{tab:beech_crowns:tab6} shows that crown type 3 crowns yielded more economically viable wood volume than the other two types for trees with similar DBH. The percentage volume of economically viable wood modeled in relation to the whole wood volume from the crown was considerably different among the crown types. Especially crowns of type 3 differed from the other 2 types. The small-end diameter of the trees did not differ between the diameter-crown type-groups from Table 6. In all DBH-crown type-groups, except for the groups below 20 cm, the group mean of the small-end diameter was randomly scattering around 10 cm. Trees in the groups below 20 cm DBH usually don?t show crown branches with a base diameter of 10 cm. Their group mean small-end diameter was not calculated.

The model output data revealed that the return per $\text{m}^3$ substantially differs between the crown types (Figure \ref{fig:beech_crowns:fig4}). Trees with crowns of the type 3 showed in mean highest returns per $\text{m}^3$ while crowns of the type 1 were by trend lowest marginal returns over the entire observed diameter range.
