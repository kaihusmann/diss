The thesis aims on evaluation, development and application of proper methods to strengthen the raw material supply of a growing bio-economy sector. It showed up that the success of a bio-based companies does, not least, depend on decisions that are made by foresters. Supporting forest management decisions is therefore beneficial not only for the forest sector itself but also for the wood processing companies. If forest enterprises and bio-economy companies were not able to contractually agree on continuous wood supply amounts, the success of a promising innovative bio-economy sector might be endangered. Forest decision-makers must therefore decide about the distribution of the available wood potential very carefully as the downstream value creation process of the wood processing sector is much higher than the value creation in the forest sector itself \citep[p. 221, 223]{elchichakli_2016}. In a scenario of wood scarcity, distribution decisions can have substantial consequences for the wood processing companies which depend on wood as raw material. This reinforces the importance of DSS in the forest management decision process as they can be used to structure the entire planning process of wood distribution into solvable sub-problems \citep[p. 1065-1067]{pretzsch_2008}. The benefits, disadvantages and findings of the distinct developed statistical models for decision support are discussed in the following.

\section{Findings of the thesis}
\label{sec:discussion:findings}
The introductory stated hypothesis, that matching demands of the rising bio-economy is actually problematic, was verified in chapter \ref{chap:hzb}. Scarcity of woody biomass and the high complexity of the entire wood supply chain are problems forest enterprises and bio-economy companies have to cope with. The descriptive analysis of the recent wood potential and the wood usage reveals significance of the research question and thus confirms the need for profound systems to support the expected raw wood distribution problem. After the relevance of the introduction question is confirmed in chapter \ref{chap:hzb}, the normative analysis in chapters \ref{chap:bm} to \ref{chap:opt} examine particular rationales why decision-makers may not exploit the wood potential fully and how optimal potentials could be calculated.

\subsection{Analyzing status and development of raw wood availability in the European beech-dominated central Germany}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:hzb}
The available wood potential of all European beech wood assortments was almost completely used in the period between 2002 and 2012 in central Germany (chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). Though the European beech wood potential is expected to rise due to the ongoing forest development programs, the competition situation on the wood market will probably rise. The only perspective for upcoming bio-economy companies to establish on the wood market is hence to get in competition with existing market participants. A detailed analyses of the wood market is therefore a prerequisite for the success of wood processing companies.

The added value of stem wood is higher than those of any other assortment \citep{nagel_2008}. The stem wood supply is recently entirely exhausted by long-established wood processing companies. It is therefore very difficult for novel companies to establish immediately on the stem wood market. The share of smaller, low-valued European beech wood assortments is about 60 \% (chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). Although this low-valued wood is recently almost entirely used as well, it seems to be partially reachable in future. Approximately half of the wood potential in smaller dimensions is directly used energetically. If a bio-economy company is able to compete with the industrial wood and firewood prices, a solid base of renewable biomass from forests will be at disposal. This would be beneficial for the forest sector as well because the added value of sorting would increase \cite[p. 67]{mohring_1997}.

Two lessons should be learned from the predicted wood scarcity. First of all, the sustainable reachable wood potential should be estimated as accurate as possible in order to investigate sources properly. Accurate estimations may uncover recently unused resources. Secondly, it should be ensured that the available potential is distributed thoroughly with view to the actual situation and also to the consequences.

\subsection{Biomass functions and nutrient contents of European beech, oak, sycamore maple and ash and their meaning for the biomass supply chain}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:bm}
The findings from chapter \ref{chap:bm} can improve gathering the complete biomass potential of mixed broadleaf forest sites. Comparison of several existing models revealed that estimation accuracy of biomass and nutrient contents in mixed broadleaf tree species sites can be significantly improved by the introduced models. This might help gathering formerly unused potential. The essay is particular relevant for the bio-based sector as innovative productions often require biomass from broadleaf tree species \citep[p. 1]{auer_2016} and the frequency of mixed broadleaf stands steadily increases \citep{ti_2014}. The models enhance the accuracy of tree-specific biomass estimations. They can thus strengthen planning accuracy of entire biomass supply chains.

\subsection{Modelling the economically viable wood in the crown of European beech trees}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:beech_crowns}
The models from chapter \ref{chap:beech_crowns} aim on the assessment of the optimal wood volume in the crowns of European beech. They can hence be used to predict the full economically viable potential of smaller wood assortments. Allometric analysis revealed great wood potentials in the crowns of broadleaf trees. It is therefore essential to consider the predicted wood volume from the crown as a by-product of stem wood production. As the dimension of the wood assortments plays a minor role for many activities (subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:bm}), gathering further wood potential from broadleaf crowns seems to be interesting for bio-economy companies. The models also allow a precise prediction of harvestable wood volume prior harvesting. They can therefore enhance the forecasting of volume flows in the biomass supply chain.

The model is able to calculate the maximal wood potential from an economic perspective only. It is therefore a purely normative-based model that predicts a rational rather than a realistic wood potential. Further economic or non-economic endogenous influences such as fixed assortments lengths or maximum small-end diameters cannot be considered in the model. It allows to calculate the maximal tree-specific wood amount but it does, of course, not predict actual decisions.

\subsection{Flexible Global Optimization with Simulated-Annealing}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:opt}
Optimization of forest stands treatments offers opportunity to calculate forest operations with highest marginal return (chapter \ref{chap:opt}). The model can be used to calculate the full wood potential of an entire forest enterprise in a time period between 10 and 20 years. It is, in contrast to the other introduced models, a model for the support of intermediate-term decisions on a lager spatial scale. Amongst the calculation of the full economic wood potential, sensitivity analysis of different optimization scenarios seems to be interesting for planning purposes. If delivery agreements with upcoming bio-economy companies or any other recipient lead to opportunity costs, source providers must balance very carefully between advantages and drawbacks. The optimization model enables the calculation of those opportunity costs. The forest decision-maker can use the result to balance between the drawback of delivery contracts and their advantages in planning security. They can decide whether the benefits in intermediate-term planning justify the opportunity costs. Furthermore, wood demander can use the results to calculate adequate wood prizes. The calculations can build an objective, evidence-based base for an agreement of intermediate-term binding wood prizes.

The combined simulation-optimization method implies high demands on the optimization algorithm (subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:opt}). A robust optimization procedure is prerequisite for a reliable simulation-optimization model. It showed up that stochastic methods with dynamic random structures were able to cope with the specific needs of the combined simulation-optimization method. The favorable optimization is hence a composition of three optimization strategies \citep{corana_1987, kirkpatrick_1983, pronzato_1984} which are all separately available as software packages. A composition of the two methods, however, is not published yet. Development of a specific software for optimization of forest thinning activities was straightforward. Intensive  sensitivity analysis revealed the applicability and the efficiency of the package as optimization element in the simulation-optimization software.

\subsubsection{First application of the simulation-optimization software}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application}
To confirm the introduced advantages of the combined simulation-optimization software, I performed optimizations for two exemplary forest enterprises. The first exemplary enterprise is comprised of five forest sites. It was used to explain the basic behavior of the optimization system. The second exemplary forest enterprise was composed of 100 systematically chosen forest sites. The sites were chosen such that all economically relevant age classes of European beech are uniformly available. The tree age distribution of the exemplary forest enterprise hence followed the characteristic distribution in the European beech dominated central Germany (Figure \ref{fig:hzb:fig3_altersklassen}). The exemplary forest enterprise represented a typical enterprise with 560 ha of forest land covering all relevant age classes and tree species. The exemplary enterprise was used to demonstrate the practical applicability of the simulation-optimization software. 

The selected sites were entirely located in the public forest district of Reinhausen \citep{nlf_2017}. The official inventory data of the sites were imported into the WaldPlaner DSS \citep{hansen_2014}. The growth and yield of each exemplary enterprise was forecasted for 20 years using standard treatment configurations. Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab1} gives an overview of the crucial settings for the standard treatment. After the simulation with these standard settings, the exemplary enterprises were forecasted with optimized treatments using the simulation-optimization software (Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:flowopt}). The optimizations were firstly performed without minimum delivery restrictions to assess their entire wood potential for 20 years. After calculation of the potential, minimum delivery restrictions for low-dimensioned deciduous wood were defined to examine the impact of delivery contracts.

\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:discussion:outlook}
The next steps will be to implement the developed and evaluated models into proper software, providing the findings for scientists, students and practitioners. The WaldPlaner DSS provides a favorable front-end for the models as it is already established in forest science and practice.

One common aim of all introduced methods is the assessment of the full wood potential from economic perspective. All models provide decision support to strengthen the economic forest function. There are, however, numerous good reasons not to fully exploit the potentials. Conservation or recreational issues, which could decrease the actual harvestable wood volume, cannot be considered immediately. Combinations of the models from chapters \ref{chap:bm} and \ref{chap:beech_crowns} with DSS could enable consideration of other forest functions. Already existing forest DSS might reduce the wood potential due to conservation or recreational issues, thereby further enhancing the prediction accuracy of wood potentials. These aspects provide further arguments for an implementation of the introduced models into the WaldPlaner. WaldPlaner allows parametrization of different treatment options \citep[p. 90-93]{hansen_2014}. Nature conservation oriented treatments will obligatory have lower yields than economic oriented treatments. If any reasons permit full exploitation of the wood potential, WaldPlaner would forecast the limited yield.

The simulation-optimization software (chapter \ref{chap:opt}) optimizes the stand development with view to economic issues. Consideration of the other two forest function is nevertheless possible. As it was performed by \citet{yousefpour_2009}, conservation and recreational issues can be simplified such that they can be implemented as restrictions into the simulation-optimization software. Restrictions, e.g. harvesting permissions of old broadleaf trees or minimum standing volumes for specific stand ages, could be included to enhance the forecasting accuracy in forest stands with specific nature conservation regulations. The influence of wood quality on the optimal stand treatment is another relevant issue that could be examined with the simulation-optimization software. To achieve this, an interface with user-specific wood prizes must be implemented.

Cooperation between wood-processing companies as well as between companies and forest enterprises is the most important advantage of the bio-economy sector, where especially the assessment of throughout raw material supply chains appears to be interesting. The introduced methods in this thesis were developed to strengthen decisions in specific parts of supply chains in order to promote the cooperation of the forest and the bio-economy sector. The statistical methods, however, cover only small distinct parts of the supply chains. To enable meaningful cooperations, they must be somehow applicable for decision-makers in forestry as well as in bio-economy or logistic companies. When implementing the models into DSS, interfaces to other software will be mandatory to take their full advantages. A front-end with an interface to logistic DSS could link the optimized wood amounts with resource distribution simulations or optimizations.
