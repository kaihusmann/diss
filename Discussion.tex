The aim of this thesis is the evaluation, development and application of robust methods to strengthen the raw material supply of a growing bio-economy sector. The success of bio-based companies depends, in part, on decisions that are made by foresters. Supporting forest management decisions is, therefore, beneficial, not only for the forest sector itself but also for wood processing companies. If forest enterprises and bio-economy companies are not able to contractually agree on continuous wood supply quantities, the success of a promising innovative bio-economy sector might be endangered. Forest decision-makers must, therefore, be very careful when deciding on the distribution of the available wood potential, as the downstream value creation process of the wood processing sector is much higher than the value creation in the forest sector itself \citep[p. 221, 223]{elchichakli_2016}. In a wood scarcity scenario, distribution decisions can have substantial consequences for wood processing companies, which depend on wood as a raw material. This reinforces the importance of DSS in the forest management decision process, as they can be used to structure the entire planning process of wood distribution into solvable sub-problems \citep[p. 1065-1067]{pretzsch_2008}. The benefits, disadvantages and results of the distinct statistical models developed here for decision support are discussed in the following.

\section{Findings of the thesis}
\label{sec:discussion:findings}
The introductory hypothesis, that matching demands of the rising bio-economy is actually problematic, was verified in chapter \ref{chap:hzb}. Scarcity of woody biomass and the high complexity of the entire wood supply chain are problems that forest enterprises and bio-economy companies have to cope with. A descriptive analysis of recent wood potential and wood usage reveals the significance of the research question and thus confirms the need for profound systems to help solve the anticipated raw wood distribution problem. After confirmation of the relevance of the introductory question in chapter \ref{chap:hzb}, the normative analysis in chapters \ref{chap:bm} to \ref{chap:opt} examine particular reasons why decision-makers may not be able to exploit the wood potential fully and how optimal potentials could be calculated.

\subsection{Analyzing status and development of raw wood availability in European beech-dominated central Germany}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:hzb}
The available wood potential of all European beech wood assortments was almost completely exhausted in central Germany in the period between 2002 and 2012 (chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). Though the European beech wood potential is expected to rise due to ongoing forest development programs, competition on the wood market will probably rise. The only way for upcoming bio-economy companies to establish on the wood market is, thus, to compete with existing market participants. A detailed analysis of the wood market is, therefore, a prerequisite for the success of wood processing companies.

The added value of stem wood is higher than those of any other assortment \citep{nagel_2008}. The stem wood supply is currently entirely exhausted by long-established wood processing companies. It is therefore very difficult for novel companies to establish immediately on the stem wood market. Smaller-dimensioned, low-valued wood assortments make up about 60 \% of the available European Beech wood (chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). Although this low-valued wood is currently almost entirely used as well, availability is forecast to be better in the future. Approximately half of the wood potential of smaller dimension wood is directly used energetically. If a bio-economy company is able to compete with industrial wood and firewood prices, a solid base of renewable biomass from forests will then become available. This would be beneficial for the forest sector as well because the added value of sorting would increase \cite[p. 67]{mohring_1997}.

Two lessons should be learned from the predicted wood scarcity. First of all, the achievable sustainable wood potential should be estimated as accurately as possible in order to evaluate sources properly. Accurate estimations may uncover currently unused resources. Secondly, decisions on the distribution of the available wood potential must be made very carefully because the success of wood processing companies crucially depends on continuous wood supply quantities. Decisions on distribution of sparse resources can hence have serious consequences for forestry enterprises as well as for wood processing companies.

\subsection{Biomass functions and nutrient contents of European beech, oak, sycamore maple and ash and their meaning for the biomass supply chain}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:bm}
The findings from chapter \ref{chap:bm} can improve harvest efficiency by making possible the gathering of the complete biomass potential of mixed broadleaf forest sites. A comparison of several existing models revealed that the introduced models can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of biomass and nutrient contents in mixed broadleaf tree species sites. This might help in identifying, and harvesting, formerly unused potential. The essay is particular relevant for the bio-based sector as innovative production methods often require biomass from broadleaf tree species \citep[p. 1]{auer_2016} and the frequency of mixed broadleaf stands is increasing steadily \citep{ti_2014}. The models enhance the accuracy of tree-specific biomass estimations. They can thus strengthen the planning accuracy of entire biomass supply chains.

\subsection{Modelling the economically viable wood in the crown of European beech trees}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:beech_crowns}
The models from chapter \ref{chap:beech_crowns} are aimed at assessing the optimal wood volume in the crowns of European beech. They can thus be used to predict the full economically viable potential of smaller wood assortments. Allometric analysis revealed large wood potential in the crowns of broadleaf trees. It is therefore essential to consider the predicted wood volume from the crown, a by-product of stem wood production. As the dimension of the wood assortments plays a minor role for many activities (subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:bm}), gathering further wood potential from broadleaf crowns would seem to be of interest for bio-economy companies. The models also allow a precise prediction of harvestable wood volume prior to harvesting. They can therefore enhance the forecasting of volume flows in the biomass supply chain.

The model is able to calculate the maximal wood potential from an economic perspective only. It is therefore a purely normative-based model that predicts a rational, rather than a realistic, wood potential. Further economic or non-economic endogenous influences, such as fixed assortment lengths or maximum small-end diameters, cannot be considered in the model. It enables the calculation of the maximal tree-specific wood amount but it does not predict actual decisions.

\subsection{Flexible Global Optimization with Simulated-Annealing}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:opt}
The optimization of forest stand treatments makes it possible to determine those forest operations with the highest marginal return (chapter \ref{chap:opt}). The model can be used to calculate the full wood potential of an entire forest enterprise in a time period of between 10 and 20 years. It is, in contrast to the other models mentioned, a model for the support of intermediate-term decisions on a lager spatial scale. The calculation of the full economic wood potential allows a sensitivity analysis of different optimization scenarios, which is of interest for planning purposes. If delivery agreements with upcoming bio-economy companies, or any other recipient, lead to opportunity costs, source providers must weigh the advantages and disadvantages very carefully. The optimization model enables the calculation of opportunity costs. The forest decision-maker can use the result to balance between the drawbacks of delivery contracts and their benefits in terms of planning security. They can decide whether the benefits in intermediate-term planning justify the opportunity costs. Furthermore, wood demander can use the results to calculate adequate wood prices. The calculations can build an objective, evidence-based fundament for a binding agreement on intermediate-term wood prizes.

The combined si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion method makes high demands on the optimization algorithm (subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:opt}). A robust optimization procedure is a prerequisite for a reliable si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion model. Stochastic methods with dynamic random structures were able to cope with the specific needs of the combined si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion method. The best optimization is hence a composition of three optimization strategies \citep{corana_1987, kirkpatrick_1983, pronzato_1984}, which are all separately available as software packages. A composition of the two methods, simulation and optimization, is however, previously unpublished. The development of a specific software solution for the optimization of forest thinning activities was straightforward. An intensive sensitivity analysis confirmed the applicability and the efficiency of the package as the optimization element in the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software.

\subsection{Application of the forest harvesting schedule optimization}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:opt:application}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:introduction}
In chapter \ref{chap:opt}, the application of the simulation-optimization model is mainly discussed from a technical perspective. In this subsection, the two examples from subsection \ref{subsec:opt:examples:forest}) are described in more detail to strengthen the discussion of the simulation-optimization model with view to research question (Section \ref{sec:intro:aim}). This subsection provides supplemental information about the parameterization and the interpretation of the two examples from chapter \ref{chap:opt}.

To explain its basic behavior and confirm its practical applicability for forest enterprises, the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software was used to calculate optimized stand developments of two exemplary forest enterprises. These two examples explain how the model can be used to support the intermediate-term forest planning. The first exemplary enterprise was created to show the basic behavior of the simulation-optimization software. It is comprised of five forest stands that were specifically chosen for exemplary purposes. The stands of the second enterprise were chosen such that they represented a typical forest enterprise of central Germany. The second example explains the reasonability of the simulation-optimization approach for typical forest enterprises of the most important region for the supply European beech wood (Section \ref{sec:hzb:Einleitung}). It is hence reflects a common forest enterprise of the most important region for the wood supply of an upcoming wood-based bio-economy industry.

The forest developments and the wood potentials of both exemplary enterprises were firstly forecasted without any optimization using standard parameterizations of the TreeGrOSS packages. To perform a sensitivity analysis, a second scenario with optimized simulated development was calculated using the simulation-optimization approach (Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:flowopt}). In a third scenario, annual minimum harvesting volumes restrictions were implemented into the optimization system. The third scenario was performed to explain how the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software can be used to examine the drawbacks of binding delivery contracts.

\subsubsection{Materials and Methods}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:method}
All selected stands of both exemplary enterprises were located in the public forest district of Reinhausen \citep{nlf_2017}. Using the WaldPlaner import plug-in \citep[p. 58]{hansen_2014}, the official inventory data of Reinhausen were used to generate TreeGrOSS forest simulation stands. The plug-in stored the stands directly in a PostgreSQL data-warehouse \citep{eisentraut_2003}. The inventory data were originally collected for the intermediate-term forest development planning in Reinhausen (see \ref{sec:intro:dss} for further details of the intermediate-term planning). All stands that built the data-base of both exemplary forest enterprises thus based on real forest stands of southern Lower Saxony. To explain the basic behavior of the optimization software, the five stands of the first enterprise were consciously chosen such that they cover a broad age range (Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab1}).

The second forest enterprise was comprised of 100 forest stands covering altogether 560 ha of forest land. The stands of the second enterprise were randomly chosen from a population of 994 forest stands covering all forest stands of Reinhausen with European beech shares of at least 10 \%. The volume distribution of tree species and tree ages in Reinhausen followed the characteristic distribution of central Germany (Figure \ref{fig:hzb:fig3_altersklassen}; \citealp{nlf_2017}). The second exemplary forest enterprise therefore represented a typical forest enterprise of central Germany in terms of enterprise size (Subsection \ref{subsec:hzb:Ergebnisse:Waldeigentum}) and tree age volume distribution of European beech. All economically relevant age classes for the European beech wood processing industry are represented in the sampled 100 stands. \textcolor{red}{Figure X} shows the volume distribution of the tree species at the date of the inventory (2011).

The si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software requires treatment settings that determine the standard scenario for the optimization (Sussection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:opt}). The respective options for the TreeGrOSS growth and yield simulation packages were developed by a work group of forest scientists and practitioners. The standard scenario represented the typical forest treatments in central Germany. Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab2} gives an overview of the crucial settings. These settings built the basis for the three scenarios that are calculated for the sensitivity analysis of the simulation-optimization model. Firstly, the standard settings were used to forecast the growth and yield of the two exemplary enterprises for 20 years using the TreeGrOSS packages. Growth and yield were hence determined in the first scenario. The first scenario represents the standard forest development without numerical optimization. After simulation of the standard scenario, the exemplary enterprises were forecasted with optimized treatments using the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software (Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:flowopt}). The second scenario was an actual numerical optimization in which the settings of the standard scenario built the reference thinning intensity. Standard settings are necessary as the optimizer can only optimize the harvesting intensity in relation to a reference (Section \ref{sec:intro:opt}). The optimizations in scenario 2 were performed without delivery restrictions in order to assess the entire wood potential for 20 years. In a third scenario, minimum delivery restrictions for low-dimensioned deciduous wood were defined to examine the impact of delivery contracts with companies from the bio-economy sector. Despite these minimum harvesting restrictions, all settings were similar to the second scenario.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:results}
As the first exemplary enterprise was composed of five stands only, the development of each stand was recorded in detail. Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab1} shows the standing volumes at the beginning of the simulations. The standard treatment simulation (scenario one) led to standing volume amounts of 308, 290, 356, 392 and 373 m$^3$ ha$^{-1}$ in 2031 in the five forest stands, where the standing volume of the fifth stand not separated by tree species. The distinct standing volumes at the end of the optimizations (scenarios 2 and 3) differed only slightly from the standing volumes at the end of the standard simulations. The highest difference amounted to only 1 \% in relation to the standard treatment simulation. The simulated yield, however, differed substantially between the three scenarios (Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig1}). Yielded wood volume from target usage was negligible. The simulated harvested wood volumes are thus not separated into target usage and thinning. It showed up that intensive harvesting in the second five-year time period is favorable in terms of total yields. The overall wood potential of the optimized treatment scenario was \textcolor{red}{X \%} higher than the standard scenario. The minimum harvesting restriction, which amounted to 5 m$^3$ year$^{-1}$ for deciduous wood, had substantial influence on the optimal stand treatments. Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig1} (right) shows that minimum restrictions lead to homogeneous yields for deciduous wood volumes. The deciduous harvesting volumes in the first time period, which was below the minimum restriction in the optimization without restrictions, amounted practically exactly the minimum restriction. This usage ahead of schedule leads to reduced growth in the following time periods. The overall wood potential of the scenario 3 is hence \textcolor{red}{X \%} below the potential of the unrestricted scenario.

\subsubsection{Discussion}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:discussion}
rh 5: 3. ist eine Umverteilung des Volumens von 1. 2. ist das beste aber entspricht nicht unbedingt den Waldbaurichtlinien

If a forest enterprise was interested in the highest wood potential only, the second scenario would be favorable.

So kann also die Wachstumssoftware die sowieso schon i nder Forstplanung benutzt wird erweitert werden. Es koennen auch optimierte Entwicklungen berechnet werden.

\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:discussion:outlook}
The next step will be to implement the developed and evaluated models into software for use by scientists, students and practitioners. The WaldPlaner DSS provides a favorable front-end for the models, as it is already established in forest science and used in practice.

One common aim of all the introduced methods is the assessment of the full wood potential from an economic perspective. All the models provide decision support to strengthen the economic forest function. There are, however, numerous good reasons not to fully exploit this potential. Conservation or recreational issues, which could decrease the actual harvestable wood volume, cannot be considered at present. Combinations of the models from chapters \ref{chap:bm} and \ref{chap:beech_crowns} with DSS could, however, enable consideration of other forest functions. Already existing forest DSS might reduce the wood potential due to conservation or recreational issues, thereby further enhancing the accuracy of predicted wood potentials. These aspects provide further arguments for an implementation of the introduced models into the WaldPlaner as the WaldPlaner allows parametrization of treatments with reduced wood potential \citep[p. 90-93]{hansen_2014}. Growth and yield simulations with nature conservation oriented treatment settings will forecast lower yields than economic oriented treatments. Combination of the presented methods from chapters \ref{chap:bm} and \ref{chap:beech_crowns} with the WaldPlaner hence enables forecasting of the stand specific wood potential with regard to economic and nature conservation issues.

The si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software (chapter \ref{chap:opt}) optimizes the stand development with a view to economic issues. Consideration of the other two forest functions is nevertheless possible. As it was performed by \citet{yousefpour_2009}, conservation and recreational issues can be simplified such that they can be implemented as restrictions into the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software. Restrictions, such as harvesting permissions of old deciduous trees or minimum standing volumes for specific stand ages, could be included to enhance the forecasting accuracy in forest stands with specific nature conservation regulations. The influence of wood quality on the optimal stand treatment is another relevant issue that could be examined with the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software. To achieve this, an interface with user-specific wood prices must be implemented.

Cooperation between wood-processing companies themselves, as well as between the companies and forest enterprises, is the most important advantage for the bio-economy sector, where the assessment of complete raw material supply chains appears to be especially interesting. The methods introduced in this thesis were developed to help strengthen decisions in specific parts of supply chains, in order to promote the cooperation of the forest and the bio-economy sector. The statistical methods, however, cover only small, distinct parts of the supply chains. To enable meaningful cooperation, they must be somehow made applicable for decision-makers in forestry, as well as in bio-economy or logistic companies. When implementing the models into DSS, interfaces to other software will be mandatory in order to take full advantage of their potential. A front-end with an interface to logistic DSS could link the optimized wood amounts with resource distribution simulations or optimizations.
