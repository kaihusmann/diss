The aim of this thesis is the evaluation, development and application of robust methods to strengthen the raw material supply of a growing bio-economy sector. The success of bio-based companies depends, in part, on decisions that are made by foresters. Supporting forest management decisions is, therefore, beneficial, not only for the forest sector itself but also for wood processing companies. If forest enterprises and bio-economy companies are not able to contractually agree on continuous wood supply quantities, the success of a promising innovative bio-economy sector might be endangered \citep[p. 221, 223]{elchichakli_2016}. In a wood scarcity scenario, distribution decisions can have substantial consequences for wood processing companies, which depend on wood as a raw material. Rational and objective decisions of the wood distribution are therefore not only important for the forestry but also of the bio-economy sector. This reinforces the importance of DSS in the forest management decision process, as they can be used to structure the entire planning process of wood distribution into solvable sub-problems \citep[p. 1065-1067]{pretzsch_2008}. The benefits, disadvantages and results of the distinct statistical models developed here for decision support are discussed in the following.

\section{Findings of the thesis}
\label{sec:discussion:findings}
The introductory hypothesis, that matching demands of the rising bio-economy is actually problematic, was verified in chapter \ref{chap:hzb}. Scarcity of woody biomass and the high complexity of the entire wood supply chain are problems that forest enterprises and bio-economy companies have to cope with. A descriptive analysis of recent wood potential and wood usage reveals the significance of the research question and thus confirms the need for profound systems to help solve the anticipated raw wood distribution problem. After confirmation of the relevance of the introductory question in chapter \ref{chap:hzb}, the normative analysis in chapters \ref{chap:bm} to \ref{chap:opt} examine particular reasons why decision-makers may not be able to exploit the wood potential fully and how optimal potentials could be calculated.

\subsection{Analyzing status and development of raw wood availability in European beech-dominated central Germany}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:hzb}
The available wood potential of all European beech wood assortments was almost completely exhausted in central Germany in the period between 2002 and 2012 (chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). Though the European beech wood potential is expected to rise due to ongoing forest development programs, competition on the wood market will probably rise. The only way for upcoming bio-economy companies to establish on the wood market is, thus, to compete with existing market participants. A detailed analysis of the wood market is, therefore, a prerequisite for the success of wood processing companies.

The added value of stem wood is higher than those of any other assortment \citep{nagel_2008}. The stem wood supply is currently entirely exhausted by long-established wood processing companies. It is therefore very difficult for novel companies to establish immediately on the stem wood market. Smaller-dimensioned, low-valued wood assortments make up about 60 \% of the available European Beech wood (chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). Although this low-valued wood is currently almost entirely used as well, availability is forecast to be better in the future. Approximately half of the wood potential of smaller dimension wood is directly used energetically. If a bio-economy company is able to compete with industrial wood and firewood prices, a solid base of renewable biomass from forests will then become available. This would be beneficial for the forest sector as well because the added value of sorting would increase \cite[p. 67]{mohring_1997}.

Two lessons should be learned from the predicted wood scarcity. First of all, the achievable sustainable wood potential should be estimated as accurately as possible in order to evaluate sources properly. Accurate estimations may uncover currently unused resources. Secondly, decisions on the distribution of the available wood potential must be made very carefully because the success of wood processing companies crucially depends on continuous wood supply quantities. Decisions on distribution of sparse resources can hence have serious consequences for forestry enterprises as well as for wood processing companies.

\subsection{Biomass functions and nutrient contents of European beech, oak, sycamore maple and ash and their meaning for the biomass supply chain}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:bm}
The findings from chapter \ref{chap:bm} can improve harvest efficiency by making possible the gathering of the complete biomass potential of mixed deciduous forest sites. A comparison of several existing models revealed that the introduced models can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of biomass and nutrient contents in mixed deciduous tree species sites. This might help in identifying, and harvesting, formerly unused potential. The essay is particular relevant for the bio-based sector as innovative production methods often require biomass from deciduous tree species \citep[p. 1]{auer_2016} and the frequency of mixed deciduous stands is increasing steadily \citep{ti_2014}. The models enhance the accuracy of tree-specific biomass estimations. They can thus strengthen the planning accuracy of entire biomass supply chains.

\subsection{Modelling the economically viable wood in the crown of European beech trees}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:beech_crowns}
The models from chapter \ref{chap:beech_crowns} are aimed at assessing the optimal wood volume in the crowns of European beech. They can thus be used to predict the full economically viable potential of smaller wood assortments. Allometric analysis revealed large wood potential in the crowns of deciduous trees. It is therefore essential to consider the predicted wood volume from the crown, a by-product of stem wood production. As the dimension of the wood assortments plays a minor role for many activities (subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:bm}), gathering further wood potential from deciduous crowns would seem to be of interest for bio-economy companies. The models also allow a precise prediction of harvestable wood volume prior to harvesting. They can therefore enhance the forecasting of volume flows in the biomass supply chain.

The model is able to calculate the maximal wood potential from an economic perspective only. It is therefore a purely normative-based model that predicts a rational, rather than a realistic, wood potential. Further economic or non-economic endogenous influences, such as fixed assortment lengths or maximum small-end diameters, cannot be considered in the model. It enables the calculation of the maximal tree-specific wood amount but it does not predict actual decisions.

\subsection{Case studies of the combined simulation-optimization approach}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:opt:application}
\subsubsection{Motivation}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:introduction}
Chapter \ref{chap:opt} introduces the statistical and technical foundations of the optimization module. The high demands on the optimization algorithm are illustrated and discussed. A solution in form of an Simulated-Annealing based optimizer, specifically developed for usage as optimization-optimization software, is presented. The applicability of the \texttt{optimization} software package for optimization of forest harvesting is briefly confirmed in two practical examples. In this subsection, the two examples from subsection \ref{subsec:opt:examples:forest}) are described in more detail to facilitate the discussion and the findings of Chapter \ref{chap:opt} with view to research question (Section \ref{sec:intro:aim}). This subsection provides supplemental information about the parameterization and the interpretation of the two examples from chapter \ref{chap:opt}.

To explain its basic behavior and confirm its practical applicability for forest enterprises, the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software was performed on two exemplary forest enterprises. The two examples were generated to explain how the model can be used to support decisions in the intermediate-term forest planning. The first exemplary enterprise was created to show the basic behavior of the simulation-optimization software. It is comprised of five forest stands that were specifically chosen for exemplary purposes. The second exemplary enterprise was composed such that it represents a typical forest enterprise of central Germany covering all relevant age classes of European beech for the bio-economy sector. The second example explains the reasonability of the simulation-optimization approach for typical forest enterprises of the most important region for the supply of the wood-based bio-economy industry (Section \ref{sec:hzb:Einleitung}).

The forest developments and the wood potentials of both exemplary enterprises were firstly forecasted without any optimization using the TreeGrOSS packages without optimization. To perform a sensitivity analysis, a second scenario with optimized simulated development was calculated using the simulation-optimization approach (Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:flowopt}). The second scenario displays the maximized wood potential of the forest enterprises. In a third scenario, annual minimum harvesting volumes restrictions were implemented into the optimization system. The third scenario was performed to explain how the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software can be used to examine the drawbacks of binding delivery contracts.

\subsubsection{Scenarios definitions}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:method}
All selected stands of both exemplary enterprises were located in the public forest district of Reinhausen \citep{nlf_2017}. Using the WaldPlaner import plug-in \citep[p. 58]{hansen_2014}, the official inventory data of Reinhausen were used to generate TreeGrOSS forest simulation stands. The plug-in stored the stands directly in a PostgreSQL data-warehouse \citep{eisentraut_2003}. The inventory data were originally collected for the intermediate-term forest planning in Reinhausen (see \ref{sec:intro:dss} for further details of the intermediate-term planning process). All stands that built the data-base of both exemplary forest enterprises thus based on real forest stands of southern Lower Saxony.

To explain the basic behavior of the optimization software, the five stands of the first enterprise were consciously chosen such that they cover the entire interesting age range for the bio-economy sector (Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab1}). Since the simulation-optimization software was programmed to support planning between the forestry and bio-economy sector and since the wood of European beech is the most interesting raw material for the upcoming wood-based bio-economy sector, the first exemplary forest enterprise was composed of European beech stands with little mixture of spruce. It was shown that wood potentials for the bio-economy sector can be found in smaller wood dimensions (Chapter \ref{chap:hzb}). The first exemplary enterprise was therefore compiled of intermediate-aged stands with average diameters (diameter of stem of mean basal area) below 30 cm where high valued stem wood from target diameter usage is not expectable during the simulation period of 20 years.

The second forest enterprise was comprised of 100 forest stands covering altogether 560 ha of forest land. The stands of the second enterprise were randomly chosen from a population of 994 forest stands. The population covered all forest stands of Reinhausen with a share of European beech above 10 \%. Reinhausen was chosen as the population for the random selection since its species- and age-volume distributions followed was very similar to the characteristic distribution in central Germany (Figure \ref{fig:hzb:fig3_altersklassen}; \citealp{nlf_2017}). The second exemplary forest enterprise therefore represented a typical forest enterprise of central Germany in terms of enterprise size (Subsection \ref{subsec:hzb:Ergebnisse:Waldeigentum}) as well as the tree age-volume distribution of European beech. All relevant wood dimensions for the wood-based bio-economy are represented in the example. Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig2} (the left bar) shows the volume distribution of the tree species at the date of the forest inventory (2011).

The si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software requires treatments settings that determine the standard scenario for the optimization (Subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:opt}). The respective options for the TreeGrOSS growth and yield simulation packages were developed by a work group of forest scientists and practitioners of central Germany. The simulation settings represented the typical forest treatments in central Germany. Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab2} gives an overview of the crucial settings. These settings built the basis for the three scenarios that are calculated for the sensitivity analysis of the simulation-optimization model. Firstly, the standard settings were used to forecast the growth and yield of the two exemplary enterprises for 20 years using the TreeGrOSS packages. Growth and yield were determined in the first scenario. The first scenario reflected the standard forest development without numerical optimization. After simulation of the standard scenario, the exemplary enterprises were forecasted with optimized treatments using the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software (Figure \ref{fig:Introduction:flowopt}). The second scenario was an actual numerical optimization in which the settings of the standard scenario built the reference. Standard settings are necessary as the optimizer can only optimize the harvesting intensity in relation to a reference scenario (Section \ref{sec:intro:opt}). The optimizations in scenario 2 were performed without delivery restrictions in order to assess the maximal wood potential for 20 years. It is the maximal achievable wood potential without violating the principle of sustainability and the enterprise-specific strategical planning (see Section \ref{sec:intro:opt} for more details). In a third scenario, minimum delivery restrictions for low-dimensioned deciduous wood from thinning activities were defined to examine the impact of delivery contracts with companies from the bio-economy sector. Despite these minimum harvesting restrictions, all settings were similar to the second scenario.

\subsubsection{Detailed results}
\label{subsubsec:discussion:struct:opt:application:results}
To enable differentiated discussions of the findings from the case studies (Subsection \ref{subsec:discussion:struct:opt}), the results of the case studies are explained in detail in the following paragraphs.

As the first exemplary enterprise was composed of five stands only, the development of each stand was recorded in detail. Table \ref{tab:discussion:struct:opt:application:tab1} shows the stand volumes at the beginning of the simulations. The simulation-optimization software was programmed such that exhausting of the forest stands is permitted. The stand volumes in the last simulated year (2031 in the examples) of all three scenarios should be very close. The stand volumes in the last simulated year are only allowed to deviate in narrow intervals (Section \ref{sec:intro:opt}). The standard treatment simulation (scenario 1) of the first exemplary enterprise led to stand volume amounts of 308, 290, 356, 392 and 373 m$^3$ ha$^{-1}$ in 2031 for the five forest stands, where the stand volume of the fifth stand not separated by tree species. The standard simulation led to increasing or constant stand volumes. This reflects the typical wood usage below the average wood growth in intermediate-ages European beech stands (Figure \ref{fig:hzb:fig4_zuw_nutz}).
it showed up that the each stand volume at the end of the optimizations (in scenario 2 as well as in scenario 3) differed only slightly from the stand volumes at the end of the standard simulations. The highest difference amounted to 2 \% in relation to the standard treatments simulations. 

\textsc{\begin{figure}[h]
		\center
		\resizebox{1\linewidth}{!}{\input{Grafiken/discussion/out_reinhausen_5.tex}}
		\caption{Summed simulated yields of the first exemplary forest enterprise in five-year periods, beginning with the period from 2011 to 2016. The simulated yield amounts are differentiated into coniferous and deciduous wood volume (including bark).}
		\label{fig:discussion:fig1}
	\end{figure}
}

The simulated yields, however, differed substantially between the three scenarios (Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig1}). Yielded wood volume from target usage was negligible in all scenarios. The simulated harvested wood volumes are thus not separated into target usage and thinning. It showed up that intensive harvesting in the second time period is favorable in terms of total yields. The optimal enterprise-specific wood potential within the simulation period would be achieved, if the stands were treated intensively between 2016 and 2021. With an overall yield of 267 m$^3$, the wood potential of the optimized treatment scenario was 32 \% higher than the potential of the standard scenario. Extremely unbalanced stand treatments performed best in terms of the total wood potential. Cooperations between forest enterprises and bio-economy companies often involve continuous wood supply (Subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:opt}). So there are good reasons why forest enterprises and bio-economy could be interested in balanced yields. This is in contrast with the results from scenarios 1 and 2. If balanced yields are of interest, minimum harvesting restrictions will be indispensable. The minimum harvesting restriction, which amounted to 4 m$^3$ year$^{-1}$ (20 m$^3$ in the 5-year period) for deciduous wood in the example, had substantial influence on the optimal stand treatments. Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig1} (right) shows that minimum restrictions led to homogeneous yields for deciduous wood volumes. The deciduous harvesting volumes in the first time period, which was below the minimum restriction in the other scenarios, amounted roughly the minimum restriction (20,7 m$^3$ in the five-year period). This reveals that usage in the first 5-year period is, under given tree species and age combinations, not reasonable in terms of wood potential optimization. External restrictions are needed to force a usage in this period. The usages of trees in period 1 were, despite a few trees, ahead of the reasonable schedule. Their individual growth potential was not used completely. A force to harvest them, of course, led to a reduced overall wood potential. The summed wood potential of the scenario 3 was 17 \% below the potential of the unrestricted scenario. This difference in the wood potentials builds the basis for the calculation of the opportunity costs. They enable a differentiated, evidence-based trade-off between advantages and drawbacks of delivery contracts. In the example, the matching of continuous wood demands reduced the total available wood potential by 40 m$^3$.

}

As the second exemplary enterprise contained too many stands to evaluate each stand volume separately, the stand volumes are displayed in sums of tree species groups. Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig2} shows the developments of the stand volumes for the standard scenario. The stand volumes in the last simulated year of all three scenarios were very close, just as it was observed in the first example. The tree scenarios differed, again, in the allocation of the harvestable wood volumes but not in the stand volumes at the end of the simulations. It showed up that the growth, by trend, exceeds the usage (Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig2}). The stand volumes increased in the simulation period. This reflects the typical stands developments in the forest district of Reinhausen \citep{nlf_2017}.

The results of the second exemplary enterprise (Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig3}) were not as obvious as the results from in the first example (Figure \ref{fig:discussion:fig1}). With 78,527 m$^3$, the optimized treatment simulation led to 9 \% higher harvesting amounts than the standard treatment simulation during the entire simulation period. Only the potentials of deciduous thinning assortments in the third and fourth time periods differed between the scenarios. The evaluation of minimum harvesting volumes for deciduous thinning assortments uncovered two results. The first, and probably very interesting result for decision-makers, was that the harvesting volumes of deciduous thinning assortments of scenario 3 differed only very slightly from the scenario 2. The definition of minimum harvesting amounts for deciduous thinning assortments above 4,500 m$^3$ in five years (900 m$^3$ year$^{-1}$) did not lead to valid results. This means that minimum harvesting restrictions above 900 m$^3$ year$^{-1}$ would violate the implemented principle of sustainability. For comparison, the actual harvesting volume in scenario 2 was 838 m$^3$ year$^{-1}$. The difference in the overall wood potential were also slight between scenario 2 and 3 (1.5 \%). The only remarkable difference were found in the allocations of the yields in the time periods three and four. Those allocations had no remarkable influence on the overall wood potential. The optimized treatment hence already reflected the continuously available volume amount of deciduous thinning assortments.

If a forest enterprise was interested in the highest wood potential only, the second scenario would be favorable.
Das BSP 2 zeigt, wie geringe nderung in der Durchforstungsplanung, unter Berucksichtigung aller Vorgaben, ein erhhtes Holzpotenzial fr die Biooeko... nur durchforstungsmaterial - Following the systematic thinning strategies of the optimized treatment scenario leads to higher wood potentials for the wood-based bio-economy without influencing the production of high-valued stem wood from target usage. 
So kann also die Wachstumssoftware die sowieso schon i nder Forstplanung benutzt wird erweitert werden. Es koennen auch optimierte Entwicklungen berechnet werden.

\subsection{Flexible Global Optimization with Simulated-Annealing}
\label{subsec:discussion:struct:opt}
The optimization of forest stand treatments makes it possible to determine those forest operations with the highest marginal return (chapter \ref{chap:opt}). The model can be used to calculate the full wood potential of an entire forest enterprise in a time period of between 10 and 20 years. It is, in contrast to the other models mentioned, a model for the support of intermediate-term decisions on a lager spatial scale. The calculation of the full economic wood potential allows a sensitivity analysis of different optimization scenarios, which is of interest for planning purposes. If delivery agreements with upcoming bio-economy companies, or any other recipient, lead to opportunity costs, source providers must weigh the advantages and disadvantages very carefully. The optimization model enables the calculation of opportunity costs. The forest decision-maker can use the result to balance between the drawbacks of delivery contracts and their benefits in terms of planning security. They can decide whether the benefits in intermediate-term planning justify the opportunity costs. Furthermore, wood demander can use the results to calculate adequate wood prices. The calculations can build an objective, evidence-based fundament for a binding agreement on intermediate-term wood prizes.

The combined si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion method makes high demands on the optimization algorithm (subsection \ref{subsec:intro:struct:opt}). A robust optimization procedure is a prerequisite for a reliable si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion model. Stochastic methods with dynamic random structures were able to cope with the specific needs of the combined si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion method. The best optimization is hence a composition of three optimization strategies \citep{corana_1987, kirkpatrick_1983, pronzato_1984}, which are all separately available as software packages. A composition of the two methods, simulation and optimization, is however, previously unpublished. The development of a specific software solution for the optimization of forest thinning activities was straightforward. An intensive sensitivity analysis confirmed the applicability and the efficiency of the package as the optimization element in the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software.



\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:discussion:outlook}
The next step will be to implement the developed and evaluated models into software for use by scientists, students and practitioners. The WaldPlaner DSS provides a favorable front-end for the models, as it is already established in forest science and used in practice.

One common aim of all the introduced methods is the assessment of the full wood potential from an economic perspective. All the models provide decision support to strengthen the economic forest function. There are, however, numerous good reasons not to fully exploit this potential. Conservation or recreational issues, which could decrease the actual harvestable wood volume, cannot be considered at present. Combinations of the models from chapters \ref{chap:bm} and \ref{chap:beech_crowns} with DSS could, however, enable consideration of other forest functions. Already existing forest DSS might reduce the wood potential due to conservation or recreational issues, thereby further enhancing the accuracy of predicted wood potentials. These aspects provide further arguments for an implementation of the introduced models into the WaldPlaner as the WaldPlaner allows parametrization of treatments with reduced wood potential \citep[p. 90-93]{hansen_2014}. Growth and yield simulations with nature conservation oriented treatment settings will forecast lower yields than economic oriented treatments. Combination of the presented methods from chapters \ref{chap:bm} and \ref{chap:beech_crowns} with the WaldPlaner hence enables forecasting of the stand specific wood potential with regard to economic and nature conservation issues.

The si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software (chapter \ref{chap:opt}) optimizes the stand development with a view to economic issues. Consideration of the other two forest functions is nevertheless possible. As it was performed by \citet{yousefpour_2009}, conservation and recreational issues can be simplified such that they can be implemented as restrictions into the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software. Restrictions, such as harvesting permissions of old deciduous trees or minimum stand volumes for specific stand ages, could be included to enhance the forecasting accuracy in forest stands with specific nature conservation regulations. The influence of wood quality on the optimal stand treatment is another relevant issue that could be examined with the si\-mu\-la\-tion-op\-ti\-mi\-za\-tion software. To achieve this, an interface with user-specific wood prices must be implemented.

Cooperation between wood-processing companies themselves, as well as between the companies and forest enterprises, is the most important advantage for the bio-economy sector, where the assessment of complete raw material supply chains appears to be especially interesting. The methods introduced in this thesis were developed to help strengthen decisions in specific parts of supply chains, in order to promote the cooperation of the forest and the bio-economy sector. The statistical methods, however, cover only small, distinct parts of the supply chains. To enable meaningful cooperation, they must be somehow made applicable for decision-makers in forestry, as well as in bio-economy or logistic companies. When implementing the models into DSS, interfaces to other software will be mandatory in order to take full advantage of their potential. A front-end with an interface to logistic DSS could link the optimized wood amounts with resource distribution simulations or optimizations.
