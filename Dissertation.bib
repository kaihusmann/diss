  Abstract                 = {The non-destructive Meyer method was evaluated to determine the bark volume of beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) stands in north of Iran. The sample size was 185 standing trees collected from 4 geographical aspects (north, south, west and east) aspects. The constant k values and bark thickness (2e mm) of 185 standing trees were used to calculate the bark volume by the Meyer method. In this study, 40 trees were randomly selected from among the felled trees and analyzed for evolution of non-destructive Meyer method. As a result, 668 diameters and 1236 bark thicknesses were measured out of 40 felled trees. The bark volumes were calculated by non-destructive Meyer and sums of integration methods. The results indicated no significant differences in volume estimates based on two methods (P = 0.816, two-tailed test), There were no significant differences in Levene?s test for equality of variances between the two methods (P=0.576, two-tailed test). The bark volume variations were significantly different in the geographical aspects. Results of this study can be important for silvicultural planning and natural forest management.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bioeconomy strategy fosters the integration of the agricultural, chemical, pulp and paper industries and the energy sector for obtaining sustainable bio-based materials and bioenergy. Basically all industrial sectors relying on biomass are facing economic burdens by resource competition. The cascade and coupled use stand as potential solutions for cross-sectoral cooperations to mutually enhance economic competitiveness. However the monitoring of trade-offs between sustainability goals of individual industries and the overall system demands extensive knowledge-based elicitations. The challenge of establishing a sustainability index arising from stakeholder's subjective perceptions of multidimensional issues requires to develop an integrated methodology out of nowadays most accepted and reliable assessment tools. This paper positions a sustainability index tool by reexamining the methodologies with regard to their appropriateness and generic strengths and weaknesses. The proposed combination of reference point approaches with preference-based elicitations is claimed as appropriate for establishing specific utility functions of sub-goals for bioeconomy.},

  Abstract                 = {A bioeconomy can be defined as an economy where the basic building blocks for materials, chemicals and energy are derived from renewable biological resources. This paper provides an overview of the bioeconomy in Europe, examining it from a policy framework and concept perspective. The role of bioenergy in the bioeconomy is discussed particularly through biofuels for transport and biorefineries. The study finds that the definitions of the bioeconomy are evolving and vary depending on the actor, but display similarities such as the emphasis on economic output and a broad, cross-sectoral focus. While there is great optimism about the benefits and opportunities associated with developing an advanced bioeconomy in Europe, significant risks and trade-offs are also expressed. Furthermore, the bioeconomy concept has been criticised for presenting a technical fix and pre-empting alternative visions. To advance a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy, this paper calls for attention on two important themes: participatory governance that engages the general public and key stakeholders in an open and informed dialogue as well as a commitment by government and industry to innovation that drives concerted efforts on sustainable development of the bioeconomy.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines alternative forest harvesting regimes when ecosystem services in terms of water quality, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation are included in the analysis. The harvesting regimes are whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and conventional stem-only harvesting. The harvesting regimes are evaluated under two alternative climate policy contexts. The first alternative is a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, which assumes the carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality of bioenergy and produces substitution benefits, as bioenergy replaces fossil fuels. The second alternative climate policy, a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy, takes into account the fact that bioenergy causes carbon dioxide emissions, producing substitution costs, and that harvested woody biomass affects the ability of a forest to act as a carbon sink. We extend the traditional Faustmann (1849) rotation model to include nutrient load damage, biodiversity benefits, and climate impacts. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish data from a catchment experiment carried out on drained peatland forests. The empirical results show that under a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, whole-tree harvesting with stump removal produces the highest net social benefits. However, if a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy is assumed, the net social benefits are greater under stem-only harvesting.},

  Abstract                 = {Allometry, in its broader sense, is concerned with the size of organisms and its consequences for their shape and functioning. Since the postulation of the allometric equation in the 1930s, allometry, in a narrow sense, refers to analysis and modelling of logarithmic transformed bivariate size data by linear regression techniques. This chapter first points out that allometric research built up a valuable set of hypotheses and biometrical methods for analysing size of organisms and its consequences for their shape and functioning. Then, a summary of the knowledge about allometry of woody plants and populations will unmask the search for overarching general allometric exponents of shape and form development largely as a hunt for a phantom. Tree size development and self-thinning processes in forest stands give evidence that allometric exponents certainly lie in a narrow corridor, but are species specific and superimposed by site conditions, mechanical disturbances, competition, and other types of stress. The discussion states that as long as allometry searches for universal constants to a certain extent, it stills our innate desire to reduce complexity and generalise. However, time is ready to focus on and understand the differences between the species, sites etc. in order to contribute to a better system of understanding. It is concluded that allometry has to draw attention both to the internal size-driven allometric partitioning process and to the external factors, which determine optimal biomass allocation. And at best, allometric research should analyse both factors in order to understand and integrate them. A systematic analysis, ordering and causal explanation of allometric exponents, which reflects an individuals tricks and traits of optimising fitness, may provide an important link between plant genetics, physiology, plant biology and population biology. In contrast, application of inaccurate and imprecise general scaling rules can cause considerable flaws in modelling, prognosis and ecosystem management.},

  Abstract                 = {General scaling rules or constants for metabolic and structural plant allometry as assumed by the theory of Euclidian geometric scaling (2/3-scaling) or metabolic scaling (3/4-scaling) may meet humans innate propensity for simplicity and generality of pattern and processes in nature. However, numerous empirical works show that variability of crown structure rather than constancy is essential for a trees success in coping with crowding. In order to link theory and empiricism, we analyzed the intra- and inter-specific scaling of crown structure for 52 tree species. The basis is data from 84 long-term plots of temperate monospecific forests under survey since 1870 and a set of 126 yield tables of angiosperm and gymnosperm forest tree species across the world. The study draws attention to (1) the intra-specific variation and correlation of the three scaling relationships: tree height versus trunk diameter, crown cross-sectional area versus trunk diameter, and tree volume versus trunk diameter, and their dependence on competition, (2) the inter-specific variation and correlation of the same scaling exponents ( TeX \{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\_\{h,d\}, \{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{csa,\}\}d\} and TeX \{\{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\}\_\{v,d\} ) across 52 tree species, and (3) the relevance of the revealed variable scaling of crown structure for leaf organs and metabolic scaling. Our results arrive at suggesting a more extended metabolic theory of ecology which includes variability and covariation between allometric relationships as prerequisite for the individual plants competitiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Competition for canopy space is a process of major importance in forest dynamics. Although virgin and old-growth European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests in Europe have been studied for many years, there are to date no studies of individual-tree crown plasticity and the way this is influenced by local neighborhood interactions in these forests. In this study, we analyzed crown plasticity and local neighborhood interactions of individual trees in the upper canopy of the old-growth beech forests of Serrahn, northeast Germany. In a 2.8-ha sample plot, we measured crown radii of all upper canopy trees and analyzed the direction and extent of crown asymmetry. Size, relative position, and distance of neighboring trees were used to construct vectors of neighborhood asymmetry within different distances from target trees. The crowns of beech trees showed strong morphological plasticity. Mean absolute and relative displacement of crown centers from the stem base were 1.95 m and 0.37, respectively. Circularcircular rank correlation coefficients between the direction of crown displacement and the direction of neighborhood pressure showed that trees strongly positioned their crowns away from local neighbors. Highest correlation coefficients were obtained when basal area and relative position of neighboring trees within a radial distance of 12 m were considered. Clark and Evans index and Ripleys K-function showed that crowns were more regularly distributed than stems. Projected canopy cover was about 10\% higher than canopy cover with simulated circular crowns. We conclude that the crowns of older beech trees have a high ability to plastically respond to changes in the local canopy conditions, enabling very effective exploitation of canopy space.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between individuals in terms of asymmetrical display of crowns and reduction of growth were followed in an experimental population of Xanthium canadense .
Competitive interaction was analysed using a neighbourhood interference model. For the analysis of morphological interaction, crown-vector, a two-dimensional vector that joins the stem base position of a plant with the centroid of its projected crown area, was used to express the direction and magnitude of the asymmetry in crown display. A model was developed in which the change in crown-vector during a growth period was expressed as a function of both the size of the focal plant and the size and location of its neighbours.
There was strong morphological interaction between crowns; they repelled each other. The competitive interaction was detectable by the competition model with crown-centres used as plant locations, but not detectable with stem bases used as plant locations.
It was concluded that the position of neighbours' crowns were important in determining the growth and crown asymmetry, which in turn determine the crown location; and morphological plasticity in crown shape works to reduce interference between individuals.Copyright 1995, 1999 Academic Press},

  Abstract                 = {Apical control is the inhibition of a lateral branch growth by shoots above it (distal shoots). If the distal shoots are cut off to remove apical control, the lateral branch can grow larger and may bend upwards. Apical control starts when new lateral buds grow after passing through a period of dormancy. Buds initially break and produce leaves, then apical control is exerted and the lower (proximal) laterals stop growing. Apical control also inhibits growth of large, old branches. Gravimorphism and restricted water and nutrient transport can inhibit branch growth, but they are not primary mechanisms of apical control. Apical control may reduce branch photosynthesis. Under apical control allocation of branch-produced assimilate to the stem is relatively high, so low assimilates in the branch may limit branch growth even though hormone levels are adequate for growth. Hormones appear to be involved in apical control, but it is not known how. One role of hormones may be to maintain the strength of the stem sink for branch-produced assimilate. Upward bending of a woody branch after release from apical control requires both new wood production and production of wood cells that can generate an upward bending moment. Apical control inhibits radial growth of branches and, in some species, may regulate the production of wood with an upward bending moment.},

  Abstract                 = {Now in widespread use, generalized additive models (GAMs) have evolved into a standard statistical methodology of considerable flexibility. While Hastie and Tibshirani's outstanding 1990 research monograph on GAMs is largely responsible for this, there has been a long-standing need for an accessible introductory treatment of the subject that also emphasizes recent penalized regression spline approaches to GAMs and the mixed model extensions of these models. á Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R imparts a thorough understanding of the theory and practical applications of GAMs and related advanced models, enabling informed use of these very flexible tools. The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and builds a well-grounded foundation through motivating chapters on linear and generalized linear models. While firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of the freely available R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practicalities of linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models, as well as their mixed effect extensions. The treatment is rich with practical examples, and it includes an entire chapter on the analysis of real data sets using R and the author's add-on package mgcv. Each chapter includes exercises, for which complete solutions are provided in an appendix. Concise, comprehensive, and essentially self-contained, Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R prepares readers with the practical skills and the theoretical background needed to use and understand GAMs and to move on to other GAM-related methods and models, such as SS-ANOVA, P-splines, backfitting and Bayesian approaches to smoothing and additive modelling.},
