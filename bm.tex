\label{chap:bm:Abstract}
Woody biomass from forests has great potential to provide a continuous and largely carbon-neutral raw material supply for the bio-based industry. As the demand for forestry products is already very high and steadily increasing, the question arises how to match the limited available wood resources to the growing demand for raw materials. Thus, there is an initial need to properly estimate the available biomass from forests. The success of a bio-based industry depends on an accurate forecast of the raw material flow coming from the forests for the entire biomass supply chain up to the industrial processing stage. Using easily measured input data, e. g. the tree diameter at breast height, biomass functions allow for a reliable prediction of tree species- and tree fraction-specific single-tree biomasses. In combination with nutrient content data, the site specific ecologically sustainable level of forestry use can be assessed and the site-specific wood utilisation potential can be fully exploited.
Biomass functions for the main tree species can be found in the literature. For other tree species, like sycamore or ash, however, there are only very specific studies available. As the wood potential of especially those species is recently often unused, goal of this study is to develop biomass functions and nutrient contents for European beech, oak, ash and sycamore for the fractions stem wood, bark, branches, and twigs.\\

For this purpose 139 trees were destructively sampled. Their single tree biomasses and nutrient contents were examined. This data was then used in a regression analysis to build generalised tree species- and tree fraction-specific biomass functions and nutrient contents for northern and central Germany.
We showed that the sycamore and ash biomass functions differed significantly from those of European beech and oak. Using oak biomass functions for the biomass estimation of sycamore and ash, as it is practised today, leads to a massive overestimation of the standing biomass in a test site up to 11 \% (21 tons / ha respectively).\\

The share of species-rich broadleaf forest stands, and thereby the importance of tree specific biomass functions, is increasing. The introduced models can help to exploit the huge biomass potential of those deciduous stands.\\

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:bm:Introduction}

Biomass from forests has real potential to provide a continuous and largely carbon-neutral supply of material to the bio-based industry sector and can therefore make a significant contribution to a clean bio-based industry. Especially small dimensioned wood has huge potential for use in bio-refineries. \citet{ekman_2013} showed in Sweden that previously unused scrap wood can be used for the extraction of high quality chemical substances, such as bio-oils or antioxidants for use in the food or cosmetics industries. Supply of biomass from forestry can drive the economic growth of the entire bio-based chemical industry and make it competitive in the long-term, especially if wood fractions that have up to now been used as fuel wood are included. Innovative industries, such as the nanofiber or biochemistry industries, are increasing the demands on the forestry product-pool. The forest-based bio-economy is already an integral part of the global forestry sector \citep{hurmekoski_2013}. The European bio-based industry is currently a growing sector, with Germany playing a leading role \citep{hennig_2016}.

The global forestry industry is currently undergoing a process of change. The use of wood as raw materials in Germany has increased considerably in the last decades \citet{mantau_2012}. Changes in government energy policy and the development of new technology led to development of new markets, in particular for small dimensioned wood \citep{geldermann_2016, mccormick_2013}. The demand for forestry products is steadily rising, increasing the competition for raw timber. The question then is how to match the available wood resource to the demand for raw materials.

Just as it is for classical forestry \citep{mohring_1997}, knowledge of the available potential biomass is the main prerequisite for a functioning bio-based industry \citep{hennig_2016}. Using wood means that the nutrients bound in the wood are removed from the forest ecosystem. The biomass potential of a forest can only be utilised to an extent that, in the long-term, won´t deplete the supply of plant available nutrients in the forest ecosystem. In order to be able to exploit the woody biomass potential for the bio-based industry, the limit of the utilisation extend from the forests stands must be known \citep{block_2013, pretzsch_2014}. Therefore, reliable estimates of the quantity of biomass to be harvested, as well as reliable estimates of the amount of nutrients contained in these biomasses are required.

Using easily measured input data, such as diameter at breast height (dbh) or tree height, biomass functions enable the prediction of single-tree biomasses. Tree species and tree-fraction specific estimations of the forest biomass supply can be made. Using these biomass functions coupled with nutrient content data, the nutrient export can be estimated. In this way an ecologically sustainable level of forestry use can be calculated and the site specific wood utilization potential can be fully exploited.

The success of the bio-based industry depends to a great extent on the ability to accurately forecast the flow of raw materials in the integrated biomass supply chain \citep{geldermann_2016, how_2016}. Using biomass functions the relevant information for strategic operational decision-making can be generated for the entire biomass supply chain - from the forest stand to the industrial processing stage. Detailed biomass calculations can improve planning certainty along the entire value chain because the masses to be transported and those due at the factory gate can be forecasted very accurately. Biomass functions can therefore make an important contribution to increasing the planning capability, and thereby to cost reductions, in operative planning for forestry enterprises, wood logistics and wood industry firms.

Wood industry cluster studies on the availability of raw materials and on the market situation of the wood industry are the bases for the strategic orientation of the bio-economy industries \citep{mccormick_2013}. By using supply analyses and material flow simulations together with biomass functions decision support models can be parameterised which enable, for example, the computing of a continuous biomass supply chain \citep[e. g.][]{ruther_2007, wordehoff_2011, mantau_2012}.

Responsible biomass usage from forests has, next to its economic relevance, also very important social impacts. In 2006, under the terms of the Kyoto protocol, reporting of the carbon sequestration performance of forests became mandatory in Germany. The use of biomass functions is an integral part of this reporting process \citep{vallet_2006, tabacchi_2011, wordehoff_2011}.

In the literature there are numerous biomass functions \citep[e. g.][]{grote_2003, cienciala_2005, pretzsch_2014} and nutrient content figures \citep[e. g.][]{augusto_2000, jacobsen_2003, weis_2012, pretzsch_2014} available for the tree species European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]), common oak (Quercus robur [L.]) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea [L.]). For sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus [L.]) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior [L.]) however, there are only few functions available. All literature functions found either do not cover the entire relevant diameter spectrum \citep[e. g.][]{albert_2014, alberti_2005} or do not allow fraction specific biomass estimation \citep{bunce_1968}.

The wood increment of long-term deciduous trees, which is the species group sycamore and ash belong to, was only used by 38 \% between 2002 and 2012 \citep{ti_2014}. This is certainly partially reasoned by the fact that reliable planning methods for long-term deciduous species are not available. The question then arises if the predictions of the woody biomass in these stands could be improved by using specific biomass functions and nutrient contents for sycamore and ash. Specific biomass functions for these species could help making the recently unused potential available for the bio-based industry.

The goal of this study is to develop biomass functions for European beech, oak, sycamore and ash by means of regression analysis, using data gathered in northern and central Germany. Functions are developed for the tree fractions stem wood (diameter > 7cm without bark), bark of stem wood, branches (1 - 7cm with bark), and twigs (< 1cm with bark). The differences in these biomass functions are examined at single-tree and stand level by means of a sensitivity analysis in an exemplary test stand. The nutrient content in the different tree fractions of the tree species studied are determined and used as the basis for quantifying the nutrient removal by harvesting. The amount of nutrients that are removed from the forest ecosystem is then determined by multiplying the nutrient content with the biomass.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:bm:methods}
With the goal of quantifying biomass and nutrient content 139 vital trees were studied (Table \ref{tab:bm:tab1}). The sample plots for beech and oak represented as many different growing areas and site conditions as possible. The high nutrient requirements of sycamore and ash meant that the sample plots for these species were exclusively on nutrient-rich, calcareous substrates. Per plot 2 - 4 trees were chosen (Fig. \ref{fig:bm:fig1}). Both within each sample site, and across the plots as a whole, the aim was to collect trees from a wide and evenly distributed diameter range.

\subsection{Data sampling and sample processing}
\label{subsec:bm:methods:sampling}

Dbh, height at crown base and tree height were measured for each tree. The fraction volumes of the trees were determined using randomized branch sampling (RBS). RBS is an efficient and bias free sampling method for estimating tree fractions \citep{saborowski_1999, Gregoire_2008}. Since this method was firstly described \citet{jessen_1955} it has been used in other studies, including those from \citet{valentine_1984}, \citet{gaffrey_1999} and \citet{affleck_2015}. This multi-stage sampling method assumes proportionality between the target quantity and an easily measurable proxy. Because an allometric relationship exists between branch volume and branch base diameter \citep{west_1999}, the RBS method makes it possible to estimate the wood volume by measuring only a subset of branch lengths and branch diameters in the tree crowns. The stem form was assessed by section-wise diameter measurements at certain tree heights up to the crown base. In order to determine the specific bulk density and nutrient contents, up to 12 samples, covering all diameters of the tree, were collected per tree using the Importance Sampling \citep{Gregoire_2008}.

Half of the samples were measured and weighted in fresh state and, after several days drying at 103 °C, in absolute dry condition in order to determine the bulk density [kg biomass (dry) / m$^3$ wood volume (fresh)] \citep{rademacher_2011}. For all stem wood samples (diameter > 7cm) the bark was separated from the wood before drying. From this samples tree species and tree fraction specific bulk density coefficients were calculated. The fraction volumes, which were previously estimated using the RBS method, could then be converted into biomasses using these bulk density coefficients. The other half of the samples underwent a chemical analysis in order to determine their nutrient concentrations. In our sample preparation and analysis we followed the widely used method by \citet{konig_2012a, konig_2012b}. In order to ensure comparability between all studied tree species, only European beech and oak samples from sample plots on nutrient-rich substrates were considered for the chemical analysis.

%% Biomass functions %%

\subsection{Biomass functions}
\label{subsec:bm:methods:bm_functions}

In order to parameterize tree species and tree fraction dependent biomass functions the single-tree biomass information was analyzed by regression analysis. The biomass functions were estimated using nonlinear Generalized Least Squares Estimation. The exponential function used in \citet{hochbichler_2006} (Equation \ref{eq:bm:eq1}) was chosen as the model type \citep{rumpf_2011}. The validity of each model was tested via visual analysis of the weighted model residuals including a comparison with theoretical residuals (quantile-quantile-analysis). Furthermore the bias of each model was calculated as the mean of the model residuals.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bm:eq1}
\hat{Y}_i=\exp{\left(\alpha+\beta \, ln(dbh_i)+\gamma \, ln(h_i)\right)}\,\varepsilon_i
\end{equation}

One general assumption in regression analysis is the independence of the model errors $\varepsilon_i$. Because this assumption is probably not met for the tree fractions within a tree species, a model distortion due to correlation between the covariates (collinearity) is possible. Not taking this collinearity into account can influence the results of a regression and thereby limit the model validity \citep{graham_2003}. In order to estimate the magnitude of the error resulting from collinearity, in addition to the single model variances $var(\hat{y}_i)$, combined model variances per tree species $\hat{\bar{y}}$ were calculated \citep{parresol_2001}. This combined model variance per tree species consists of the single model variances $var(\hat{y}_i)$ and the model co-variances $cov(\hat{y}_i, \hat{y}_j)$ between the fraction functions for a respective tree species (Equation \ref{eq:bm:eq2}). The correlation between two fractions  was estimated using a linear correlation coefficient of the measured biomasses.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bm:eq2}
var(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)={wait} {for} {proof}
\end{equation}

The multiplicative error term $\varepsilon_i$ of the nonlinear biomass function (Equation \ref{eq:bm:eq2}) implies an increasing variance with increasing covariate dimension. We quantified the resulting heteroscedasticity by parameterizing a power function with the model residuals over the fitted values. This function was then used to weight the residuals of the actual fit. Thus, neither the variances of the distinct biomass functions $var(\hat{y}_i)$ nor the combined model variance $var(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)$ showed heteroscedasticity.

In order to make the single model variances $var(\hat{y}_i)$ comparable to each other, to the variances of other biomass functions in the literature and to the combined model variances per tree species $var(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)$, dimensionless coefficients of variation for each model $i$ were calculated (Equation \ref{eq:bm:eq3}), where $j$ is the index for the observed tree. These coefficients of variation were also calculated for the combined model error $v(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)$. $v(\hat{y}_i)$ and $v(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)$ thus represent the normalized deviation of the models. They are calculated as the quotient of the deviation and the estimated response. This normalization is advantageous since it scales every residuum by its expected dimension thereby making it easily interpretable and comparable. The absolute deviation would, due to the heteroscedasticity, increase with increasing dimension of the response $y_{ij}$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bm:eq3}
var(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)={wait} {for} {proof}
\end{equation}

where $i$ denotes the fraction and $j$ the observed tree. $N_i$ is the number of observations in fraction $i$. The entire regression analysis was performed using with the R package "nlme" \citep{venables_2002}. Additionally, we calculated the likelihood-ratio based pseudo-r-squared for each model using "MuMIn" \citep{barton_2016}.

To enable a comparison between the biomass functions for the different tree species 95 \% confidence intervals were computed for European beech and oak using bootstrapping \citep{diciccio_1996}. To do this every regression model for these two species was repeated 1,000 times using sub-samples of the original data which were selected randomly by drawing with replacement. In order to prevent the sample size influencing the width of the confidence intervals, the number of samples in every repetition matched the actual number of samples. All analyses were performed using the R software \citet{r_core_team_2016}.

\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
\label{subsec:bm:methods:sensitivity}
To analyze the behavior of our models, the biomass functions were applied on a real forest site. This site was chosen for testing purposes only. The trees of the site were not included in the regression analyses. The research site is located ca. 15 km east of the city of Göttingen. It is a mixed stand with European beech, sycamore and ash, which is typical for this region. The site is on a sun exposed slope with a stony substrate consisting of the products of limestone weathering overlain by a thin layer of loess (Table \ref{tab:bm:tab2}). It has a good nutrient and a good water supply.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on this test site, 5 simulated test sites, differing in their species composition, were generated. For this, the proportions of the 3 tree species in the real stand were modified using the "WaldPlaner" forest simulator \citep{hansen_2014}. With this software we randomly cloned original trees from the test site until the target mix ratio was achieved.

%% Nutrient contents %%
%%-------------------%%
\subsection{Nutrient contents}
\label{subsec:bm:methods:nutrients}
To consider site sustainability is to ask the question - how to best manage the scarce nutrient resources available? To do this, the nutrient response efficiencies of the distinct species and fractions appear to be a reasonable \citep{henderson_2012}. The nutrient response efficiency \citep{vitousek_1982} tells us how much carbon [kg] can be bound by a plant per 1 kg of applied nutrients. According to \citet{vitousek_1982}, we define the response efficiency as the inverse of the element concentration of the biomass. It is the ratio of carbon to the other mineral nutrients. The tree and fraction specific nutrient response efficiency of each nutrient is thus calculated by dividing the carbon concentration by the respective nutrient concentration in the tree fractions. It determines how much nutrient must be assimilated to grow a certain amount of biomass. Trees with high nutrient response efficiency need less nutrients to grow the same amount of biomass in the respective fraction than a plant with lower nutrient response efficiency. The total tree nutrient response efficiency was calculated by dividing the total tree concentration of carbon, the sum of all 4 fractions, by the total concentration of the respective nutrient. From the samples that were chemically tested, the average nutrient response efficiencies per tree species and were calculated. This was achieved by calculating the mean nutrient response efficiencies per tree species from the single-tree values.

\subsection{Biomass functions}
\label{subsec:bm:results:bm_functions}

The numbers of parameters in the biomass functions were determined by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) \citet{akaike_1981}. By including tree height in the models for stem wood and bark the AIC scores were lowered markedly. This was observed for all species. In those cases, where tree height had a significant influence on the biomass, additional models were calculated with the dbh as the only independent variable. As a consequence of this, for each of the tree species there is an easily applicable dbh model available for each function. The coefficients of variation $v(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)$ and $v(\hat{y}_i)$ allowed a direct comparison of the single and the combined variances. In those cases in which the tree height coefficient was significant the model coefficients of variation were markedly reduced by its inclusion. The coefficients of variation fall into two groups (Table \ref{tab:bm:tab3}). The coefficients of variation for the functions of stem wood and bark of the stem wood are clearly smaller than those for branches and twigs. Even if the height is not included $v(\hat{y}_i)$ of the stem wood and bark models is substantially smaller than $v(\hat{y}_i)$ of the branches and twigs.

Altogether $v(\hat{y}_i)$ ranged from 0.02 to 0.28. With values between 0.03 and 0.04, the combined model coefficients of variation when collinearity is taken into account (Equation \ref{eq:bm:eq2}) were always small. The combined $v(\hat{\bar{y}}_i)$ were calculated from the respective best models (the models with height parameter for stem wood and bark). The combined model coefficients for the European beech, oak and ash models were very close to the coefficients for stem wood and stem wood bark. Although there were correlations between fractions, these were higher for models with low variance. Accordingly the combined model coefficients of variation for European beech, oak and ash were low. Only the sycamore model showed considerable difference between the combined model variation coefficients and the variation coefficients of stem wood and bark of the stem wood. This is explained by the relatively high correlation between the stem wood biomass with the branch and twig biomasses. Despite this, because the coefficients of variation for the sycamore stem wood and bark models are relatively low, the combined model coefficients of variation are approximately the same as those for European beech and oak. As the residuals of each model as well as all biases were not trending and each bias was near 0, it can be assumed that all models are valid. The highest relative bias found amounted only 1.8 \% of the mean expectation.

A comparison of the biomass models should show whether separate biomass functions for sycamore and ash are necessary. For this purpose confidence intervals were generated for the European beech and oak functions (Figure \ref{fig:bm:fig2}). We chose the 2-parametric functions with dbh as only descriptive variable for the model comparison. For stem wood there was no overlap across the whole spectrum of dbh. The curves of the stem wood functions of the 4 tree species ran more or less equidistant from one-another, with the European beech stem wood function lying above those of all other species. The lower confidence limit for the European beech stem wood function lay very near to the expected value. The European beech confidence interval had therefore no overlap with the other biomass functions. Although the oak stem wood function ran between the sycamore and ash functions, there was also no overlap with the other stem wood functions because the confidence intervals were comparatively narrow.

For the bark models there were also no areas of overlap between the graphs. The bark biomass functions could be separated into 2 groups. The graph of the sycamore bark biomass function ran very near to that of European beech. Due to the relatively large data pool and the small data variance, the confidence intervals for the European beech models were very narrow so, despite the proximity on the graph, there was no overlap with the sycamore function. The bark biomass functions for ash and oak lay almost twice as high on the graph as those of European beech and sycamore. The confidence interval of the oak function was much wider than the European beech confidence interval. The distance between the oak and ash functions is, however, so large that there was no overlap between the two.

The confidence intervals of the branch functions were altogether much wider than those of the stem wood and bark functions. The confidence interval of the European beech branch model enclosed the oak function and vice-versa. The sycamore function for branch biomass overlapped with the European beech confidence interval in the dbh range between 35 - 50 cm and with the oak function confidence interval in the range 30 - 45 cm. The graphs of the sycamore and ash branch biomass functions were, however, much steeper. Consequently there is a clear difference between the sycamore and ash branch models to the European beech and oak models.

The graphs of the 4 twig biomass models were indistinguishable over most of the value range. The confidence intervals of these functions were very asymmetric and even wider than the branch function confidence intervals. The confidence interval of the European beech function was the widest and enclosed all the other functions across the whole diameter range. The confidence interval of the oak function was slightly narrower and enclosed the European beech and sycamore functions from a dbh of ca. 40 cm and higher. The function graph of the sycamore function ran within the confidence intervals of both European beech and oak over much of the dbh value range. It was, however, much steeper than all other models. The graph of the ash function lies close under that of the European beech function. Consequently, the twig functions are mostly indistinguishable by means of the confidence interval analysis although their curvature is partially different.

The proportion of stem wood in the tree biomass increased disproportionately high with increasing dbh. For the oak functions the stem wood percentage increased sharply at first, from 56 \% by dbh 10 cm to 68 \% by dbh 20 cm. By dbh 60 cm the stem wood share of the biomass was 79 \% but did not increase much further after that. On average the stem wood share was 72 \%. The proportion of the bark biomass was more or less constant at ca. 14 \%. The share of branch as well as twig biomasses decreased with increasing dbh. The share reduced from 26 \% to 5 \% for branch and 4 \% to 1 \% for the twig biomass in the observed diameter range. The relationships between the tree fractions of the other tree species were comparable. The stem wood percentage for European beech increased from 78 \% to 89 \% in the diameter range 20 cm to 60 cm, that of sycamore from 77 \% to 81 \% and ash from 73 \% to 81 \%. For each tree species the stem wood share increases digressively and nears an asymptote. Above a dbh of ca. 60 cm the stem wood share in the tree species studied did not change much. The share of bark in the total biomass for European beech (6 \%) sycamore (9 \%), and ash (10 \%) remained relatively constant. The share of biomasses in branches and twigs thus also decreased with increasing dbh for those 3 tree species.

\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
\label{subsec:bm:results:sensitivity}

In order to assess the magnitude of the effect that different biomass functions can have on results at the stand level, real and simulated test stands were used (Tables \ref{tab:bm:tab2} and \ref{tab:bm:tab4}). The sum of the total aboveground biomasses for all trees in these stands was firstly calculated with the tree species specific biomass functions. Then, secondly, the sum of the total aboveground biomasses was again calculated using only the oak biomass functions for estimating biomasses of sycamore and ash trees. The full tree biomass at the stand level for the first test stand (proportion European beech: 75 \%) was calculated to be ca. 200 t ha$^{-1}$ when using tree specific biomass functions. Using oak biomass functions for sycamore and ash led to a 4 \% overestimation of the stand biomass (ca. 7 t ha-1). The difference between the two calculation methods increased steadily with a decreasing proportion of European beech, reaching a maximum overestimation of 11 \% (21 t ha$^{-1}$) for a stand with an equal tree species mixture. If the proportion of European beech was held constant, then the difference of the total aboveground biomass on stand level increased with a decreasing ash percentage in the stand. In every case the estimated total biomass at the stand level was lower when separate, species specific, biomass functions were used.

\subsection{Nutrient contents}
\label{subsec:bm:results:nutrients}

In our analysis, the nutrient contents differed particularly between the tree species. In order to examine significant differences, we performed a parametric one-way analysis of variance for each nutrient and fraction combination with 5 \% significance level. The mean nutrients contents are listed in Table \ref{tab:bm:tab5}. All of the nutrient content data in the fraction and species groups were approximately normally distributed. For this, simple arithmetic group means are sufficient for data description and model building. This mean nutrients contents allows the tree and fraction specific calculation of the nutrients by multiplying its biomass with the respective element content from Table \ref{tab:bm:tab5}.

With ca. 500 g kg$^{-1}$ (dry biomass) in stem wood, as well as in bark, carbon has the greatest share of any element content in the entire dry weight. The average carbon content lies between 475 g kg$^{-1}$ and 509 g kg$^{-1}$, with slight differences between the tree species and fractions. In the stem wood sycamore differs significantly from beech while the carbon contents of other combinations do not differ significantly. In the bark fraction, ash and sycamore differ significantly from oak and beech. For sycamore and ash, the carbon content in the stem bark is a little lower than in the stem wood. The average nutrient contents, with the exception of a few calcium contents in the branches of sycamore and ash, were < 25 g kg-1. With few exceptions, the content of the various nutrients in wood can be ranked as follows: N > K > Ca > Mg > P = S. Ash has the largest potassium content (1.65 g kg$^{-1}$) of all 4 tree species. The potassium content in ash is throughout significantly higher than in all other examined species. In terms of the magnesium content, the trees can be separated into two groups. The mean content is significantly higher for sycamore and European beech than for oak and ash. Generally, the nutrient contents in bark are between 3 (N, P and K) and 25 (Ca) times higher than in wood. The concentrations of nitrogen, phosphor and sulfur in sycamore bark are always significantly higher than those of European beech and than those in the bark of oak and ash. The bark of ash has significantly lower nitrogen concentrations than the other species but higher potassium content.
