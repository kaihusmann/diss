  Abstract                 = {In felled-tree studies, ratio and regression estimators are commonly used to convert more readily measured branch characteristics to dry crown mass estimates. In some cases, data from multiple trees are pooled to form these estimates. This research evaluates the utility of both tactics in the estimation of crown biomass following randomized branch sampling (RBS). Synthetic generalized regression (GREG) estimators are developed, and their properties examined against standard estimators. It is shown that synthetic GREG estimators with zero or low design-bias can be obtained, and that the variance of a design-unbiased class of GREG estimators can be unbiasedly estimated. Simulated sampling from 20 censused crowns of two Rocky Mountain species indicated that improvements in accuracy can be obtained through GREG estimation following RBS. Simulations also showed that synthetic GREG estimators that pool data from multiple trees can stabilize coefficients of multivariate regression models to provide improved accuracy over direct GREG estimators. However, for the univariate regression models that proved most adept for the censused crowns, direct GREG estimation provided the lowest average root mean squared error (RMSE) for RBS. Simulations also showed that model-based branch aggregation estimators have generally low RMSE but can be heavily design-biased. For the crown forms studied, use of branch auxiliary information at both the design and estimation stages through RBS and GREG estimation appears to be more efficient than using the information only at the estimation stage following simple or stratified random sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {With an increasing demand of sustainable raw materials for bioenergy use, coppicing as management approach to increase the biomass production of forests is becoming of greater importance. This study describes the parameterization of biomass equations for six tree species traditionally used in coppices forests, namely sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), field maple (Acer campestre L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), and common hazel (Corylus avellana L.) growing in coppice-with-standard systems in Lower Saxony, Germany. The parameterization was based on measurements of over 950 trees sampled from two forest sites. The sampled trees were felled and separated into three biomass compartments (stem, coarse branches, and fine brushwood) and weighed on site. The dry weight of sub samples from each compartment was measured. Equations were derived for total aboveground biomass, stem biomass, and crown biomass using regression analyses. We either used diameter at breast height as single independent explanatory variable or in combination with tree height. Biomass production of stump sprouts and generatively grown stems was compared for ash and sycamore maple. In the same age classes, it was found that ash stump sprouts had a slightly higher production than seed-grown stems. For sycamore maple, no difference was detected.},

  Abstract                 = {The non-destructive Meyer method was evaluated to determine the bark volume of beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) stands in north of Iran. The sample size was 185 standing trees collected from 4 geographical aspects (north, south, west and east) aspects. The constant k values and bark thickness (2e mm) of 185 standing trees were used to calculate the bark volume by the Meyer method. In this study, 40 trees were randomly selected from among the felled trees and analyzed for evolution of non-destructive Meyer method. As a result, 668 diameters and 1236 bark thicknesses were measured out of 40 felled trees. The bark volumes were calculated by non-destructive Meyer and sums of integration methods. The results indicated no significant differences in volume estimates based on two methods (P = 0.816, two-tailed test), There were no significant differences in Levene?s test for equality of variances between the two methods (P=0.576, two-tailed test). The bark volume variations were significantly different in the geographical aspects. Results of this study can be important for silvicultural planning and natural forest management.},

The trees were growing on both siliceous and calcareous soils of variable depth. Correlations between loge tree dry weight and loge girth were higher (r = 0.9977-0.9871), than with loge height (r = 0· 9547-0.8147). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the inclusion of height only marginally improved the tree dry weight estimates. Regression equations, of the form loge y = a + b (loge x), where y = tree dry weight (trunk + branches) and x = tree girth at 1.3 m, were used to predict tree dry weight. The 95\% confidence limits of the estimates were generally in the range of ± 10-15\%, but in some examples as low as ± 2\% and up to ± 20-30\%, depending upon the sample number and variance of the particular regression. The regression equations for species from different sites exhibited small but significant differences as tested by analysis of variance. Equations derived from trees of all species provided acceptable estimates, but the most valid predictions of tree dry weight are obtained from species samples felled in the area for which estimates are required. Correlations between stem and branch categories and girth (in loge terms) were lower than for total tree weight and girth.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a trans-disciplinary assessment of new and innovative biorefinery concepts producing high-value chemical compounds from residues from agriculture, food and forest industries. There is a significant potential of biomass residues in Sweden suitable for the extraction of various compounds, including upgrading by biocatalytic processes, in addition to current energy generation. Two examples presented are quercetin extracted from onion waste by pressurised hot water in conjunction with enzymatic hydrolysis, and betulin from birch bark extracted by liquid CO2 containing ethanol. Inherent in these two extraction processes and production routes is the ability to show good environmental performance from a life cycle perspective. Extraction of high-value compounds also provides possibilities for innovation in the current agricultural, food and forest industry potentially leading to socio-economical benefits.},

  Abstract                 = {In light of various environmental problems and challenges concerning resource allocation, the utilisation of renewable resources is increasingly important for the efficient use of raw materials. Therefore, cascading utilisation (i.e., the multiple material utilisations of renewable resources prior to their conversion into energy) and approaches that aim to further increase resource efficiency (e.g., the utilisation of by-products) can be considered guiding principles. This paper therefore introduces the Special Volume “Improved Resource Efficiency and Cascading Utilisation of Renewable Materials”. Because both research aspects, resource efficiency and cascading utilisation, belong to several disciplines, the Special Volume adopts an interdisciplinary perspective and presents 16 articles, which can be divided into four subjects: Innovative Materials based on Renewable Resources and their Impact on Sustainability and Resource Efficiency, Quantitative Models for the Integrated Optimisation of Production and Distribution in Networks for Renewable Resources, Information Technology-based Collaboration in Value Generating Networks for Renewable Resources, and Consumer Behaviour towards Eco-friendly Products. The interdisciplinary perspective allows a comprehensive overview of current research on resource efficiency, which is supplemented with 15 book reviews showing the extent to which textbooks of selected disciplines already refer to resource efficiency. This introductory article highlights the relevance of the four subjects, presents summaries of all papers, and discusses future research directions. The overall contribution of the Special Volume is that it bridges the resource efficiency research of selected disciplines and that it presents several approaches for more environmentally sound production and consumption.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the debate and research of the transition towards a bio-based economy a shortfall in considering and evaluating the actual available sustainable biomass potential for realizing this emerging concept can be noted. This paper provides insights into the role of feedstock availability and provision in particular addressing the current scientific discussion on the availability and cost provision of biomass resources in the context of energy production, and the implications for the technological concepts, mainly biorefineries. A lack of a harmonized methodological approach covering minimum requirements for determining biomass potentials can be seen. This does not allow a comparison and aggregation of the data for receiving a bigger picture on the feedstock potential. Consequently, academia and decision makers may not take a final position on the possible magnitude of an emerging bio-economy at the moment. The presented examples also reveal that a more distributed production might allow developing a larger share of the available biomass potential.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bioeconomy strategy fosters the integration of the agricultural, chemical, pulp and paper industries and the energy sector for obtaining sustainable bio-based materials and bioenergy. Basically all industrial sectors relying on biomass are facing economic burdens by resource competition. The cascade and coupled use stand as potential solutions for cross-sectoral cooperations to mutually enhance economic competitiveness. However the monitoring of trade-offs between sustainability goals of individual industries and the overall system demands extensive knowledge-based elicitations. The challenge of establishing a sustainability index arising from stakeholder's subjective perceptions of multidimensional issues requires to develop an integrated methodology out of nowadays most accepted and reliable assessment tools. This paper positions a sustainability index tool by reexamining the methodologies with regard to their appropriateness and generic strengths and weaknesses. The proposed combination of reference point approaches with preference-based elicitations is claimed as appropriate for establishing specific utility functions of sub-goals for bioeconomy.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, an improved mathematical model is proposed to solve the multi-echelon biomass supply chain synthesis problem, including processing hubs selection, biomass allocation design and transportation mode selection, with the consideration of vehicle capacity constraint (weight and volume). On top of that, carbon emission penalty is introduced in the model in order to evaluate the environmental impact in the supply chain. The entire problem is modelled through mixed integer non-linear programming with the aim of maximising the overall profit, at the same time ensuring the minimal CO2 emission. A comparative study between the model developed in the previous work (vehicle capacity constraint and environmental performance are not considered) and the current improved model is carried out to compare the reliability of the outcomes. Both models are illustrated by using a same case study in Johor, Malaysia. In order to fill the gap of lacking user-friendly decision-making tool for the transportation design in supply chain management, a novel graphical decision-making tool, called smart vehicle selection diagram is proposed in this paper. The diagrams are constructed based on the optimised results obtained from the formulated model. The user manual for the proposed decision-making tool is given in this paper. Besides, five sets of sensitivity analysis are conducted to identify the sensitivity of the assumed realistic factors (i.e. terrain profile, weather changes, traffic congestion, fuel price fluctuation and individual environmental preference) to the optimal results obtained from the proposed tools. This paper shows the potential of the proposed tools in providing rigid optimal solution for the proposed research problem. Finally, several potential future works is suggested in this paper to fill up some of the remaining research gaps.},

  Abstract                 = {Outlook studies have long traditions in the forest sector – they have been conducted regularly since the 1950s. Until very recently, the approaches used in these studies have remained relatively unchanged. However, the global forest sector has been faced with major structural changes and its operating environment has become ever more complex and interlinked with other sectors. The aim of this article is to review the forest sector outlook approaches in face of these changes, and to analyze how well they have been able to capture and project the changes. Moreover, we raise the question of whether they seem informative enough for the purposes of today's decision makers and other stakeholders. The results indicate that the existing outlook studies have not been able to sufficiently capture the structural changes in global paper markets, and it may be that they have difficulties in considering the possible structural changes in other markets as well. In order to assess the changes occurring in the operating environment more systematically, and to better meet the needs of policy-makers and stakeholders, there are potential advantages in complementing the current modeling approach dominant in the forest sector with other methods from the field of foresight.},

  Abstract                 = {A bioeconomy can be defined as an economy where the basic building blocks for materials, chemicals and energy are derived from renewable biological resources. This paper provides an overview of the bioeconomy in Europe, examining it from a policy framework and concept perspective. The role of bioenergy in the bioeconomy is discussed particularly through biofuels for transport and biorefineries. The study finds that the definitions of the bioeconomy are evolving and vary depending on the actor, but display similarities such as the emphasis on economic output and a broad, cross-sectoral focus. While there is great optimism about the benefits and opportunities associated with developing an advanced bioeconomy in Europe, significant risks and trade-offs are also expressed. Furthermore, the bioeconomy concept has been criticised for presenting a technical fix and pre-empting alternative visions. To advance a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy, this paper calls for attention on two important themes: participatory governance that engages the general public and key stakeholders in an open and informed dialogue as well as a commitment by government and industry to innovation that drives concerted efforts on sustainable development of the bioeconomy.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines alternative forest harvesting regimes when ecosystem services in terms of water quality, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation are included in the analysis. The harvesting regimes are whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and conventional stem-only harvesting. The harvesting regimes are evaluated under two alternative climate policy contexts. The first alternative is a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, which assumes the carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality of bioenergy and produces substitution benefits, as bioenergy replaces fossil fuels. The second alternative climate policy, a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy, takes into account the fact that bioenergy causes carbon dioxide emissions, producing substitution costs, and that harvested woody biomass affects the ability of a forest to act as a carbon sink. We extend the traditional Faustmann (1849) rotation model to include nutrient load damage, biodiversity benefits, and climate impacts. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish data from a catchment experiment carried out on drained peatland forests. The empirical results show that under a carbon neutral bioenergy policy, whole-tree harvesting with stump removal produces the highest net social benefits. However, if a carbon non-neutral bioenergy policy is assumed, the net social benefits are greater under stem-only harvesting.},

  Abstract                 = {Allometry, in its broader sense, is concerned with the size of organisms and its consequences for their shape and functioning. Since the postulation of the allometric equation in the 1930s, allometry, in a narrow sense, refers to analysis and modelling of logarithmic transformed bivariate size data by linear regression techniques. This chapter first points out that allometric research built up a valuable set of hypotheses and biometrical methods for analysing size of organisms and its consequences for their shape and functioning. Then, a summary of the knowledge about allometry of woody plants and populations will unmask the search for overarching general allometric exponents of shape and form development largely as a hunt for a phantom. Tree size development and self-thinning processes in forest stands give evidence that allometric exponents certainly lie in a narrow corridor, but are species specific and superimposed by site conditions, mechanical disturbances, competition, and other types of stress. The discussion states that as long as allometry searches for universal constants to a certain extent, it stills our innate desire to reduce complexity and generalise. However, time is ready to focus on and understand the differences between the species, sites etc. in order to contribute to a better system of understanding. It is concluded that allometry has to draw attention both to the internal size-driven allometric partitioning process and to the external factors, which determine optimal biomass allocation. And at best, allometric research should analyse both factors in order to understand and integrate them. A systematic analysis, ordering and causal explanation of allometric exponents, which reflects an individuals’ tricks and traits of optimising fitness, may provide an important link between plant genetics, physiology, plant biology and population biology. In contrast, application of inaccurate and imprecise general scaling rules can cause considerable flaws in modelling, prognosis and ecosystem management.},

  Abstract                 = {General scaling rules or constants for metabolic and structural plant allometry as assumed by the theory of Euclidian geometric scaling (2/3-scaling) or metabolic scaling (3/4-scaling) may meet human’s innate propensity for simplicity and generality of pattern and processes in nature. However, numerous empirical works show that variability of crown structure rather than constancy is essential for a tree’s success in coping with crowding. In order to link theory and empiricism, we analyzed the intra- and inter-specific scaling of crown structure for 52 tree species. The basis is data from 84 long-term plots of temperate monospecific forests under survey since 1870 and a set of 126 yield tables of angiosperm and gymnosperm forest tree species across the world. The study draws attention to (1) the intra-specific variation and correlation of the three scaling relationships: tree height versus trunk diameter, crown cross-sectional area versus trunk diameter, and tree volume versus trunk diameter, and their dependence on competition, (2) the inter-specific variation and correlation of the same scaling exponents ( TeX \{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\_\{h,d\}, \{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{csa,\}\}d\} and TeX \{\{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\}\_\{v,d\} ) across 52 tree species, and (3) the relevance of the revealed variable scaling of crown structure for leaf organs and metabolic scaling. Our results arrive at suggesting a more extended metabolic theory of ecology which includes variability and covariation between allometric relationships as prerequisite for the individual plant’s competitiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Competition for canopy space is a process of major importance in forest dynamics. Although virgin and old-growth European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests in Europe have been studied for many years, there are to date no studies of individual-tree crown plasticity and the way this is influenced by local neighborhood interactions in these forests. In this study, we analyzed crown plasticity and local neighborhood interactions of individual trees in the upper canopy of the old-growth beech forests of Serrahn, northeast Germany. In a 2.8-ha sample plot, we measured crown radii of all upper canopy trees and analyzed the direction and extent of crown asymmetry. Size, relative position, and distance of neighboring trees were used to construct vectors of neighborhood asymmetry within different distances from target trees. The crowns of beech trees showed strong morphological plasticity. Mean absolute and relative displacement of crown centers from the stem base were 1.95 m and 0.37, respectively. Circular–circular rank correlation coefficients between the direction of crown displacement and the direction of neighborhood pressure showed that trees strongly positioned their crowns away from local neighbors. Highest correlation coefficients were obtained when basal area and relative position of neighboring trees within a radial distance of 12 m were considered. Clark and Evans index and Ripley’s K-function showed that crowns were more regularly distributed than stems. Projected canopy cover was about 10\% higher than canopy cover with simulated circular crowns. We conclude that the crowns of older beech trees have a high ability to plastically respond to changes in the local canopy conditions, enabling very effective exploitation of canopy space.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we present equations derived for the prediction of the aboveground tree volume and phytomass for twenty-five of the most important forest species growing in Italy. These equations result from ongoing research aiming to fill a gap in the models available at the national scale. With regard to volume, the results are particularly important for thirteen species or groups of species that were once scaled with models, conventionally assumed as reference models, available for other species. In Italy, phytomass models had never been constructed at the national level before. For any single tree, specific equations allow estimations of the following tree components to be made: stem and large branches (for either volume or phytomass), small branches (phytomass), stump (phytomass) and the whole tree phytomass. The models have been constructed on the basis of nearly 1,300 sampling units (sample trees). Although these equations must be considered intermediate results of the ongoing research because only half the scheduled number of samples has been collected, they have already been used in the practice, for example in the estimates reported in the recently published second national forest inventory.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between individuals in terms of asymmetrical display of crowns and reduction of growth were followed in an experimental population of Xanthium canadense .
Competitive interaction was analysed using a neighbourhood interference model. For the analysis of morphological interaction, crown-vector, a two-dimensional vector that joins the stem base position of a plant with the centroid of its projected crown area, was used to express the direction and magnitude of the asymmetry in crown display. A model was developed in which the change in crown-vector during a growth period was expressed as a function of both the size of the focal plant and the size and location of its neighbours.
There was strong morphological interaction between crowns; they repelled each other. The competitive interaction was detectable by the competition model with crown-centres used as plant locations, but not detectable with stem bases used as plant locations.
It was concluded that the position of neighbours' crowns were important in determining the growth and crown asymmetry, which in turn determine the crown location; and morphological plasticity in crown shape works to reduce interference between individuals.Copyright 1995, 1999 Academic Press},

  Abstract                 = {In order to improve the estimation of carbon stored in the French forest biomass from National Forest Inventory data, we developed six species-specific equations for estimating the total aboveground volume of trees, including merchantable volume, branches and twigs. Equations use circumference at breast height and total height as independent variables. They were built from even-aged forests of the Landes massif, the northern half and the eastern mountain regions of France. The sample was selected within archives of volume measurements taken in growth and yield permanent plots between 1920 and 1955. It is made up of 4619 trees belonging to seven important species: 1222 Sessile Oak, 1293 Common Beech, 347 Douglas Fir, 309 Norway Spruce, 389 Scots Pine, 297 Maritime Pine and 762 Silver Fir. These trees were felled and measured in 26 different forests (62 stands). Tree form factor was analysed, rather than volume, to remove heteroscedasticity, and height was substituted by a hardiness coefficient to remove diameter–height correlation. The analysis identified species-specific modes of variation of tree form with respect to developmental stage and tree hardiness. Maritime and Scots Pine did not differ statistically, despite large differences between ecological and silvicultural situations of both species. This suggests the possibility to use identical volume equations for species belonging to the same genus. Regional variations of tree form were explored by a cross-validation technique. Prediction biases did not exhibit a clear geographic structure. A 5\% overestimation for hardwoods in southern sites is possible, and would deserve further testing. The hypothesis that recent growth changes may have slightly altered tree form is also discussed. Finally, a national-scale application provided Biomass Expansion Factors consistent with former studies and suggested that these volume equations behave well in extrapolation to coppices, uneven-aged or mixed stands.},

  Abstract                 = {Apical control is the inhibition of a lateral branch growth by shoots above it (distal shoots). If the distal shoots are cut off to remove apical control, the lateral branch can grow larger and may bend upwards. Apical control starts when new lateral buds grow after passing through a period of dormancy. Buds initially break and produce leaves, then apical control is exerted and the lower (proximal) laterals stop growing. Apical control also inhibits growth of large, old branches. Gravimorphism and restricted water and nutrient transport can inhibit branch growth, but they are not primary mechanisms of apical control. Apical control may reduce branch photosynthesis. Under apical control allocation of branch-produced assimilate to the stem is relatively high, so low assimilates in the branch may limit branch growth even though hormone levels are adequate for growth. Hormones appear to be involved in apical control, but it is not known how. One role of hormones may be to maintain the strength of the stem sink for branch-produced assimilate. Upward bending of a woody branch after release from apical control requires both new wood production and production of wood cells that can generate an upward bending moment. Apical control inhibits radial growth of branches and, in some species, may regulate the production of wood with an upward bending moment.},

  Abstract                 = {Now in widespread use, generalized additive models (GAMs) have evolved into a standard statistical methodology of considerable flexibility. While Hastie and Tibshirani's outstanding 1990 research monograph on GAMs is largely responsible for this, there has been a long-standing need for an accessible introductory treatment of the subject that also emphasizes recent penalized regression spline approaches to GAMs and the mixed model extensions of these models. á Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R imparts a thorough understanding of the theory and practical applications of GAMs and related advanced models, enabling informed use of these very flexible tools. The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and builds a well-grounded foundation through motivating chapters on linear and generalized linear models. While firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of the freely available R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practicalities of linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models, as well as their mixed effect extensions. The treatment is rich with practical examples, and it includes an entire chapter on the analysis of real data sets using R and the author's add-on package mgcv. Each chapter includes exercises, for which complete solutions are provided in an appendix. Concise, comprehensive, and essentially self-contained, Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R prepares readers with the practical skills and the theoretical background needed to use and understand GAMs and to move on to other GAM-related methods and models, such as SS-ANOVA, P-splines, backfitting and Bayesian approaches to smoothing and additive modelling.},

Auf der Basis von Inventurdaten und Szenarienrechnungen werden die Mengen an Kohlenstoff hergeleitet, die heute bzw. künftig in niedersächsischen Wäldern und in den aus niedersächsischem Holz hergestellten Produkten gespeichert werden. Die Kohlenstoffstudie richtet sich an alle Betriebe der Forst- und Holzwirtschaft, politische Entscheidungsträger und die interessierte Öffentlichkeit. Sie liefert wichtige Argumente im Kyoto-Folgeprozess und zeigt die Auswirkungen verschiedener waldbaulicher Strategien auf die Kohlenstoffspeicherung in Wäldern und Forstprodukten auf.},
